there is a lot of info in this one but I think it was a very good article and want to share with you many people are help by chemo and radiation and this is not mean to downplay the benefit from they if dietary and lifestyle change can help prevent the multilication of cancer cell easy medication for I to swallow johns hopkins update this is an extremely good article everyone should read it after year of tell people chemotherapy is the only way to try try being the key word to eliminate cancer johns hopkins is finally start to tell you there is an alternative way cancer update from johns hopkins 1 every person have cancer cell in the body these cancer cell do not show up in the standard test until they have multiply to a few billion when doctor tell cancer patient that there are no more cancer cell in their body after treatment it just mean the test are unable to detect the cancer cell because they have not reach the detectable size 2 cancer cell occur between 6 to more than 10 time in a person lifetime 3 when the person immune system is strong the cancer cell will be destroy and prevent from multiply and form tumor 4 when a person have cancer it indicate the person have nutritional deficiency these could be due to genetic but also to environmental food and lifestyle factor 5 to overcome the multiple nutritional deficiency change diet to eat more adequately and healthy 4 5 time day and by include supplement will strengthen the immune system 6 chemotherapy involve poison the rapidly grow cancer cell and also destroy rapidly grow healthy cell in the bone marrow gastrointestinal tract and so on and can cause organ damage like liver kidney heart lung and so on 7 radiation while destroy cancer cell also burn scar and damage healthy cell tissue and organ 8 initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size however prolong use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction 9 when the body have too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromise or destroy hence the person can succumb to various kind of infection and complication 10 chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cell to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy surgery can also cause cancer cell to spread to other site 11 an effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cell by not feed it with the food it need to multiply cancer cell feed on a sugar substitute like nutrasweet equal spoonful and so on are make with aspartame and it is harmful a well natural substitute would be manuka honey or molasse but only in very small amount table salt have a chemical add to make it white in color well alternative is braggs aminos or sea salt b milk cause the body to produce mucus especially in the gastro intestinal tract cancer feed on mucus by cut off milk and substitute with unsweetened soy milk cancer cell are being starve c cancer cell thrive in an acid environment a meat base diet is acidic and it is good to eat fish and a little other meat like chicken meat also contain livestock antibiotic growth hormone and parasite which are all harmful especially to people with cancer d a diet make of 80 fresh vegetable and juice whole grain seed nuts and a little fruit help put the body into an alkaline environment about 20 can be from cook food include bean fresh vegetable juice provide live enzyme that are easily absorb and reach down to cellular level within 15 minute to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cell to obtain live enzyme for build healthy cell try and drink fresh vegetable juice most vegetable include be an sprout and eat some raw vegetable 2 or 3 time a day enzyme are destroy at temperature of 104 degree f 40 degree c e avoid coffee tea and chocolate which have high caffeine green tea is a well alternative and have cancer fighting property water well to drink purified water or filter to avoid know toxin and heavy metal in tap water distil water is acidic avoid it 12 meat protein is difficult to digest and require a lot of digestive enzyme undigested meat remain in the intestine become putrefied and lead to more toxic buildup 13 cancer cell wall have a tough protein cover by refrain from or eat less meat it free more enzyme to attack the protein wall of cancer cell and allow the bodys killer cell to destroy the cancer cell 14 some supplement build up the immune system ip6 flor ssence essiac anti oxidant vitamin mineral efas and so on to enable the body own killer cell to destroy cancer cell other supplement like vitamin e are know to cause apoptosis or program cell death the bodys normal method of dispose of damage unwanted or unneeded cell 15 cancer is a disease of the mind body and spirit a proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor anger un forgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit learn to relax and enjoy life 16 cancer cell can not thrive in an oxygenate environment exercise daily and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level oxygen therapy is another mean employ to destroy cancer cell 1 no plastic container in micro 2 no water bottle in freezer 3 no plastic wrap in microwave johns hopkins have recently send this out in its newsletter this information is being circulate at walter reed army medical center as well dioxin chemical cause cancer especially breast cancer dioxin are highly poisonous to the cell of our body do not freeze your plastic bottle with water in they as this release dioxin from the plastic recently dr edward fujimoto wellness program manager at castle hospital was on a tv program to explain this health hazard he talk about dioxin and how bad they are for we he say that we should not be heat our food in the microwave use plastic container this especially apply to food that contain fat he say that the combination of fat high heat and plastic release dioxin into the food and ultimately into the cell of the body instead he recommend use glass such as corn ware pyrex or ceramic container for heating food you get the same result only without the dioxin so such thing as tv dinner instant raman and soup and so on should be remove from the container and heat in something else paper is not bad but you do not know what is in the paper it is just safe to use temper glass corning ware and so on he remind we that a while ago some of the fast food restaurant move away from the foam container to paper the dioxin problem is one of the reason please share this with your whole email list also he point out that plastic wrap such as saran is just as dangerous when place over food to be cook in the microwave as the food is nuke the high heat cause poisonous toxin to actually melt out of the plastic wrap and drip into the food cover food with a paper towel instead this is an article that should be send to anyone important in your life,neutral,0

we all know it is breast cancer awareness month but every time I hear about it see pink and so on I break down I am 49 and my good friend of 47 year was a survivor yep she hit 5 year then 8 and then we figure at about 8 year and 1 month bamb she was tell she have lung cancer the goal was to remove she left low lobe and that would be that well a week later she was have brain surgery because she have 2 lesion on her brain then in less than 2 week they find 5 more lesion on her brain and have what I think is call a gama knife or something like that so her lung treatment basically got put on hold she is have both radiation and chemo and it is just too much she is have another pet scan on monday but I know what this all mean it is like they just forget about the lung cancer part of her treatment to take care of her brain so this is where I need honest answer it is my responsibility to be there for she be her shoulder her rock but also I need to be realistic I will never take her hope away from she but I am confused when my father lung cancer come back and go to his brain I see how the medical profession basically give he false hope and drain every penny of his retirement so I am kind of familiar with how this work my question is when do the doctor stop take your money stop the experimental treatment that are not cover under your insurance when do your gut tell you when I first find out about her breast cancer return I look up information on the internet and it say it can be from week to 7 9 month I just need to know what to expect it make I absolutely sick to my stomach when I think of this and have pray so hard that if the lord do in fact answer prayer to please give I her cancer she have two small girl and a wonderful husband I am single no child and would absolutely take on this burden for she take her pain so if there is anyone that could please be 100 honest with I I do not care how brutal the fact will be I just need the fact thank you anyone that reply this is hard to do alone I fricken hate cancer when I say it is hard to do alone what I mean is the fact that I have to hold on to my emotion and let her mood drive our conversation we cry together laugh together but we do not mention what is to come below is her feeling about this month and all of the pink and I do not blame she for being angry I remember her joy at 5 year and it seem everything on tv is either a political ad or a commercial of what walk are go on to raise fund for breast cancer please pray for my dear friend here is her post and again thank you for take the time to read this and what is the most amazing thing about my dear friend is her want to reach out to other so they do not have to experience what she have today begin the start of breast cancer awareness month a subject very close to my heart there are a lot lot of people who jump on the bandwagon product pop up pink everywhere it is really kind of shove in our face that is all great let we raise fund but most importantly be proactive about your own health get your mammogram and check yourself monthly encourage the woman you love to do so as well and even the one you barely like this is a horrible disease that rob we of our time our hair and sometimes our life let we stop it before it hit,negative,-1

I have 3 small per annum sized bump around my nipple on my right breast they were hard like knot and swollen stand out from the skin not rest inside the skin like a pimple I ask my primary care physician about this back when the first one develop about 2 year ago she say it was more than likely a swollen or infected montgomery gland and that it was totally normal especially because I have have my nipple pierce at the time however since it ache and hurt I insist on a mammogram I am almost 27 year old family history of breast cancer so I know how important it is to be check my mammogram come back with clean result after the first bump I was not too concerned and just shrug it off I take out the piercing as not have the bump was more of a concern to I than keep the piercing about 4 month ago two more of these little bump sprout up almost form a triangle around my nipple they are all hard raise and painful as I was clean they one day I accidentally squeeze the old one and it pop I was mortify so much puss come out and it was not like a pimple at all it was like a hard more dry out puss and so much of it after the puss come out it bleed more than I think it would require I to change the bandage several time I notice once I clean it out there was a hole where the bump have been almost like a crater nothing like a pimple but an actual opening that go down into my skin you could see inside this open the only thing I can compare it to it when I was bit by a brown recluse the puss and the opening after it was clean the only difference is the skin surround these lump look like regular areola not red black and decay like the spider bite my doctor continue to insist this is normal but it is been freak I out so I take it upon myself to get rid of they since she insist they were so harmless and I would cut off a wart on my finger before with no problem the first one open on it is own I clean it out and bandage it I purchase a brand new set of nail clipper sterilize they and the skin and try to cut one open I could not do it it hurt like I was try to cut a chunk of my finger off it surprise I it was almost like my bump have nerve ending in they not common with swollen montgomery gland at least in my understanding since it hurt too badly to cut off completely I just cut a gash into the side and drain the puss after which I clean and sterilize the utensil and opening after each cut aside from the opening the pain is go and the bump are no long there to stand out they are heal fairly well it is difficult to air they out since they are on my breast but I was wonder if anyone know of a down side or side effect that someone else may have get from do this or something along these line I have never hear of anyone else try to get rid of they themselves so I figure what the h e double hockey stick I will keep this thread update as they heal progress if they get bad or go away altogether and so on any input is greatly appreciate,negative,-1

hill first the marketing campaign of the lead tobacco company have unfortunately been extremely effective second the management of these company have a complete disregard for the health of the woman

I notice a statement in another post by retirednavy that mention the liver and it get I think about my father I just find out that I am heterozygous factor v leiden positive my father have many health issue and is consider knee surgery so we think it would be good for he to be test my interest was peak by the mention of the liver role in clotting because my father have a liver transplant 10 year ago I start search the web and I have find enough information to make it seem like there is a possibility that a new liver could impact your clotting factor but I could not find any really good information it seem like they talk more about the donor being positive and not the recipient I am curious about whether or not the test for factor v leiden are still valid after a liver transplant is it possible that the result of this test could be change by the acquisition of a new liver or if he is also positive then the new liver would not change this I am hope his liver doctor can help shed some light on this but I think I would ask here to see if anyone know anything on this topic or could point I to some information that might be helpful thank,neutral,0

so a year ago I go to doctor to get a scan do on my back because of weird back pain I would be have in thoracic region seemingly unrelated to any injury they take x ray of my chest area and notice nothing except the doctor strangely feel my stomach may have a gastric outlet obstruction and send I for a ct scan of abdomen which rule out any sort of obstruction they draw blood seem normal ok one year later my back pain have come and go and return in same general thoracic area I have also been notice pain in the tailbone area also unrelated to injury particularly after sit for a period I feel it may have been from slouch while drive so I have correct that and the pain have still persist it is get to point where I almost have to angle my body to sit on either cheek to lessen it this have been last well over month now I look online and notice a few people have note this tailbone pain with colon cancer I have been check my stool and notice no blood in toilet but do on occasion notice a tiny bit of blood on the tp my stool seem to be generally normal I guess sometimes narrow but not super usually soft ish and basically always light brown another symptom I sometimes deal with is strange shortness of breath for no reason not gasp for air but a feeling that I am not get sufficient oxygen even while sit I am wonder if all this stuff is connect something definitely feel wrong I have not been feel great for over a year run down some day bad than other not sure where to turn next if I have lung cancer I imagine that would show on the chest x ray I have a year ago if I have colon cancer I imagine that would probably be indicate on the stomach ct scan any idea where I should go next something definitely is not right with I look for answer or suggestion thank you,neutral,0
hello everyone julian is still recover from his induction round of chemo we are very hopeful that he will be in remission so that we can move straight to transplant after his count are up I am wonder whether any of you have have the problem of unsolicited advice from people who are concerned about whether your doctor are do the right thing I have a facebook page for julian for friend and family to follow yesterday I get a message from a parent of another child with leukemia I believe this child actually have all but that is not really the point this parent was try to convince I that I should be push julians medical team to reconsider the use of my babys cord blood even though that could result in a delay of several week and we do not know that this baby will be a match he claim that he have do research for his own son whom he feel do not have a suitable donor at all and that sible cord blood is far superior to unrelated cord blood he have opt not to do a transplant at all for his own son that is not even an option in julians case if chemo only do not work before I am certain that it is not the answer now either I am concern however about his claim about cord blood I do not want to do a internet search on my own because I already know the anxiety it create I do e mail julian transplant doctor to ask about his claim he also think I should get second third fourth fifth opinion but with julian neutropenic and in the hospital that is very difficult to do not only that but I really do believe that university of minnesota is the place to be for pediatric transplant anybody else been through this or have any advice invite in this case of course thank you jacki,negative,-1

and difficulty swallow the symptom tend to last for week or month at a time and do not go away without treatment in some case infection result in death treatment so far there is no cure for aid but some drug regimen that combine medication such as azt retrovir with ritonavir or norvir are prove effective at strengthen immunity and keep infection at bay thereby prolong the life of many aids sufferer combination drug therapy have benefit many people for year but it is still unclear how long the drug will remain effective especially since effectiveness vary significantly from person to person the drug must also be take in large quantity usually on a daily basis and there are many side effect when drug treatment is stop new symptom can arise or old one return if you re pregnant and

cancer several strain of hpv cause external genital wart how it is contract through oral anal and vaginal sex and through skin to skin contact to help prevent infection use a condom it is not clear exactly how effective condom are at protect against hpv and genital wart but they will protect you against other stds include hiv testing once a woman become sexually active or by age 18 she should get an annual pap smear to detect any abnormal change in the cervix pap smear are the first line of defense against the hpv family of virus which is typically without symptom if your pap test come back abnormal your doctor will likely order a second one to confirm the result a cervical dna swab test can also be perform to identify which specific hpv virus you have only a few type of hpv have been link to cervical cancer and these are usually not the one that cause genital wart if hpv is find a colposcopy a test that examine the tissue of the vagina and cervix use a magnifying lens is usually order for genital wart the cervix and vaginal area are examine and a sample is scrape from the wart surface for diagnosis man are examine and diagnose the same way incubation period one month to several year symptom many type of hpv have no symptom though some cause visible genital wart that may be find in the vagina or urethra or on the cervix vulva penis or anus rarely they are find in the mouth or throat wart are often flesh color soft to the touch and may look like miniature cauliflower floret they usually grow in more than one area and are often painless although they may itch treatment there is no cure for hpv so treatment aim at control outbreak of wart if you have a strain that cause visible wart if a woman is diagnose with certain strain of hpv her doctor may suggest a biopsy of cervical tissue to check for sign of cancer it is important to note that many woman with hpv do not get cervical cancer but hpv infection is an important risk factor for the disease further treatment vary widely depend on what your doctor learn from a colposcopy dna testing and or a biopsy of cervical tissue to treat visible genital wart there are several chemical that can be directly apply some are prescribe for use at home other may cause discomfort and must only be use under a doctor supervision and some may not be use during pregnancy genital wart also may be remove use cryotherapy freezing burn off with electrocauterization or remove with surgery or laser in at least 30 percent of treat case the wart grow back again if you are not treat since there are strain of hpv that are link to cervical cancer fail to seek treatment can be fatal but since many type of hpv are basically harmless they need only be monitor with yearly pap smear or more frequently every three to six month if a result come back abnormal if genital wart are allow to grow without treatment they can block the vagina urethra or anus and become very uncomfortable depend on where they are on the body genital wart can cause sore and bleed an increase in the size and number of the wart is also more likely during pregnancy and when a person immune system is compromise by diabete an organ transplant hodgkin disease or hiv aid among other condition scabie what it is a mite that burrow under the skin and lay egg how it is contract through close contact or through sleep in bed or wear

baby by touch syphilis sore chancre and then touch the baby testing diagnosis of syphilis is do through a blood test and or examination of secretion from chancre incubation period one week to three month symptom during the first stage of a syphilis infection painless sore or open ulcer may appear on the anus vagina penis or inside the mouth and occasionally on other part of the body during the second stage roughly three week to three month after the first symptom appear an infected person may experience flu like symptom and possibly hair loss or a rash on the sol and palm and in some case all over the body there are also latent phase of syphilis infection during which symptom are absent treatment antibiotic usually penicillin are prescribe if you are not treat untreated syphili can lead to serious damage to the brain and the nervous system mental deterioration a loss of balance vision and sensation leg pain and heart disease a fetus is at particular risk if the mother do not seek treatment the chance for stillbirth and serious birth defect include blindness are very high trichomoniasis what it is a bacterial infection that result in sore on the mouth throat lip anus tongue vagina or penis how it is contract you can get chancroid sore or spread they through skin to skin contact with open sore from hand that have touch a sore or from sex toy such as a vibrator or dildo that have touch a sore testing chancroid lesion can look like syphilis or genital herpe so a doctor need to analyze the discharge from the sore to get an accurate diagnosis incubation period 12 hour to five day symptom painful open sore on the genital and in some case swollen and tender lymph node in the groin area woman may be less likely to get the sore instead their symptom may include painful urination or defecation painful intercourse rectal bleeding or vaginal discharge treatment antibiotic are usually effective if you are not treat the sore that remain from an untreated chancroid infection may put you at risk for other stds as well as other type of infection talk with your partner and test now first you can talk with your partner and hopefully he or she will agree to go for test std testing is available at clinic and doctor office throughout bc it is a good idea to test before any sexual contact or as soon as possible after you start have sex you may need to retest at a later time window period and limitation of std testing std testing require some time between when a person is infect and when the test can be expect to identify the infection these are call window period or incubation period they vary from a few day to 6 month during incubation or window period an infected person can transmit the disease to someone else the window period if you are do a blood test tend to be long than for other test as they are for the most part test the person immune response rather than for the bug itself remember with std testing that you can still develop the infection after the test are take a person could therefore have receive recent negative test result yet still have an infection that could be transmit to other also while test are mostly accurate they can be falsely negative and very occasionally falsely positive how do I know when the window period begin and end it can be difficult at the beginning of a relationship to have to question each other about previous sexual contact most people therefore choose the time they decide to be mutually monogamous as the time to consider as the beginning of the window period if neither partner have have any sexual contact for 6 month or more some couple decide the window period begin 6 month before they meet and end at the time they meet they then choose not to retest this is safe as long as both partner have really not have sex for 6 month or more another option in order to cover these window period is to identify your last contact with a previous sex partner and take that as the starting point for calculate the time to retest even if you were with that partner for a long time select the last time that you have sexual contact with that person as the beginning of the window period stds are not necessarily pass every time an infected person have sex with a partner it could happen any time therefore to be safe consider the last sexual contact the time to start the clock run for the window period specific std window period gonorrhea the incubation period for gonorrhea is usually 2 to 7 day chlamydia the incubation period for chlamydia is usually 2 to 6 week but can be long syphilis the incubation period for syphilis is usually 10 to 90 day hiv the window period for hiv is usually 2 week to 3 month but could be up to 6 month hepatitis a the incubation period for hepatitis a is 15 to 50 day hepatitis b the incubation period for hepatitis b is usually 45 180 day with an average of 60 to 90 day hepatitis c the incubation period for hepatitis c range from 2 week to 6 month commonly 6 to 9 week talk with your partner about herpe wart there are no test for genital wart and herpe test are not necessarily useful herpe culture require an active lesion to be present and herpe blood test do not indicate whether the infection is genital or oral most people test positive on herpe blood test because they were expose to the virus orally as a child it is therefore a good idea to discuss these 2 disease with any new partner have you or your partner ever have genital herpe or cold sore on the mouth have either of you ever have genital wart diagnose both of these disease are common and having have either or both should not necessarily interfere with your relationship discuss these 2 disease early in a relationship can reduce the chance of transmission test later as the incubation period for chlamydia is up to 6 week you can test at or after 6 week from the start of your relationship it make sense to test for gonorrhea at the same time the blood test syphilis hiv and possibly hepatitis can be take at 3 month most result would show up on an hiv and hepatitis test within 3 month of infection but these test can be repeat 6 month into the relationship to fully cover the window period stop the use of condom one reason couple seek std testing is so that they can safely stop use condom you need to test to cover the window period for the disease and make sure any issue concern herpe and wart have been resolve heterosexual couple who are not intend to start a family need to find an alternative form of contraception many people wish to stop use condom as soon as possible as the romance intensifie and people feel more comfortable with each other it is easy to start to feel that this partner could not possibly have an std and condom are an unnecessary barrier however when the relationship is over sometimes not too long afterwards many people will regret the decision to have unprotected sex to reduce std infection it is good to reduce the number of lifetime contact in particular unprotected contact the long you use condom the well,neutral,0

this is from dr murray and he is work with natural factor supplement he is a naturopathic doctor I stumble onto this while serache for article on low platelet statistic from the world health organization estimate that 350 million individual have chronic hepatitis the most serious form of chronic hepatitis is chronic hepatitis c chc it is suspect that there are at present more than 5 million people in the united states that are infect with chc and perhaps as many as 200 million around the world that is roughly 5 of the world population the death rate from hepatitis c exceed that from aids the drug of choice in conventional medicine for chronic hepatitis is alpha interferon a very expensive treatment that produce benefit in only about 1 3 of case fortunately several natural compound exert some benefit of their own and may also improve the effective of alpha interferon in particular glucuronate silybin phytosome and a component from licorice root have all show promise before discuss these supplement let I first prescribe a dose of common sense avoid put undue stress on the liver do not smoke drink little or no alcohol avoid caffeine and do your good to avoid harmful chemical especially clean solvent and pesticide the most important dietary guideline for support good liver function are also those that support good general health avoid saturate fat refined sugar and alcohol drink at least 48 ounce of water each day and consume plenty of vegetable and legume for their high fiber and nutrient content certain food are particularly helpful because they contain the nutrient your body need to produce and activate the dozen of enzyme involve in the various phase of detoxification such food include garlic legume onion egg and other food with a high sulfur content good source of water soluble fiber such as pear oat bran apple and legume cabbage family vegetable especially broccoli brussels sprout and cabbage artichoke beet carrot dandelion green and many herb and spice such as turmeric cinnamon and licorice green food like wheat grass juice dehydrate barley grass juice chlorella and spirulina in addition to these dietary recommendation there are three key supplement from natural factor that I recommend as a foundation for good health remember he work for natural factor a high potency multiple vitamin and mineral multistart a high quality green drink enrich green a pharmaceutical grade fish oil supplement rxomega 3 factor for people with hepatitis c additional support is need I would highly recommend take one serve of detoxitech a scientifically design drink mix pack full of hypoallergenic protein and specific aid to detoxification include fiber and substance design to boost glutathione one of the bodys key molecule of detoxification lastly I would recommend take liver health formula from natural factor two capsule one to three time daily with dosage being base upon a person size and severity of viral load here is a brief description of each component glucuronate is a nutritional substance use by the liver to bind to toxin to help eliminate they from the system this process is use to detoxify many hormone food

hi everybody well see the pulmonologist yesterday the pft result were good except for the carbon monoxide and I am sure that s because of smoking finally someone was able to show I the ct scan so I could see the nodule all the fuss have bee about the doctor say it do not look like a normal cancer whatever normal cancer is but it is borderline he say because of the nodule the enlarged lymph node and the history of smoking he could not rule anything out he give I three choice wait three month to see what happen have a pet scan or a wedge resection I am not one to wait and I do not want surgery unless I have to so I choose the pet scan can anyone give I some info on it he explain it pretty well but I am still very nervous this all start in october and seem like it is take forever sorry just really need to vent some of the anxiety and I know people on here understand I am try to stay positive and tell myself that maybe I will get good news for xmas but sometimes its hard especially since my husband and I make the choice not to let our family in on what s go on so hard not to be able to share the worry and confusion well any comment are welcome as always everyone on the board remain in my prayer and positive thought thank you all so much,negative,-1

ok in the first issue of this subject I try to explain why I have issue with lactulose as a treatment for encephalopathy the main concern I have was that by use lactulose an osmotic pressure was set up between the blood supply and the low intestine which cause ammonia to be filter out of the blood supply thus reduce the impact of hepatic encehalopathy the issue here was that not only was the ammonia filter out in part but also was many of the nutrient and vitamin necessary for life food and its nutrient were being flush from the body before the digestive process have time to extract the goodness from the food so while decrease the level of ammonia lactulose also decrease the level of many other nutrient a post this evening by seeking2 raise a question about ascite the question being why do the volume of ascitic fluid vary when paracentecis is undertake so now we have two issue the first being he treat by lactulose the second being ascite treat by paracentisis and diuretics question is there a connection between he and ascite the answer is yes there is the connection between the two is portal hypertension portal hypertension is an increase blood pressure in the portal vein which carry all the blood from the intestine back to the liver the blood from the entire intestine the spleen pancrea and gall bladder enter the liver via the portal vein once inside the liver the vein divide in to left and right branch and then in to tiny channel that run through the liver when the blood leave the liver it enter the hepatic vein and go back to body wide circulation two factor can increase the pressure in the portal vein 1 increase blood supply flow through the liver 2 increase resistance to the blood flow through the liver the most common cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis scar the liver due to alcohol intake imagine if you will the liver which in a normal person is like a sponge soft and squidgy blood is able to work its way easily through the liver as water go through a sponge in a cirrhotic liver most of the sponginess have gone being replace by scar tissue which is hard and not conducive to blood flow the liver therefore become an obstruction rather than a filter channel and from this several problem can occur the first problem that arise is varix small blood vessel form call collateral vessel which directly connect the portal vein with the general blood supply the most important of these develop at the low end of the esophagus and at the upper part of the stomach here these vessel become engorge and full of twist and turn and effectively become varicose vein these vein are liable to rupture but can be band to stop they bleed severe varix can lead to death the second problem that arise is ascite pressure in the blood supply go to the liver force ascitic fluid out of the liver and the intestine to leak into the abdominal cavity thus increase portal hypertension lead to increase volume of ascitic fluid the third problem that occur is wait for it encephalopathy because of the pressure on the portal vein new vein get form to bypass the liver some of these will end up cause varice but the other rejoin the main blood distribution system thus bypass the liver and all of its filter action one of the toxin remain in this unfiltered blood is ammonia ammonia accumulate in the brain and now we have encephalopathy therefore the condition of varie encephalopathy and ascite are all cause by portal hypertension phew so go a long way back to seeking2s question about why volume and frequency of ascite fluid change it is all down to portal hyper tension in my own case I go from 4th stage compensate to 4th stage decompensate in a matter of week my first paracenticis produce a whopping 12 liter of ascitic fluid subsequent draining do not produce anywhere near as much and indeed the last draining I have do only produce 5 liter what do change though was the frequency with which I need drain initially it start as every 7 week then every month and so on until it come down to have two draining in one week miraculously in april I have my last paracenticis and have been clear of ascite ever since what cause this to happen presumably the reduction on the need for have ascitic fluid remove was as a direct result of reduce portal hypertension that is reduce pressure in the portal vein ok why do the pressure in the portal vein drop this was presumably again that my liver function have start improve and indeed from april 2009 was when my condition and well being start its improvement successive blood test have show improved liver function as a result of not drink after 6 month without alcohol my liver function have improve to the point that it was no long an obstruction to blood flow from the portal vein please note that have ascite do not mean one have encephalopathy or varix but I believe that people who suffer encephalopathy also suffer ascite and perhaps varix please let I know if you disagree with this statement where do we go from here the next issue will look at other mean of address some of these issue particularly with respect to encephalopathy and how other way of address these problem may result in improve quality of life for many people comment appreciate as always I hope this stuff is useful and of some interest it certainly help I to sort thing out in my own mind

I was recently diagnose with colon cancer which appear to be isolate in the cecum but I would not really know until surgery I am still wait on the test result to determine if I have lynch syndrome but I am try to decide if I am positive for lynch if I want to go with the right colectomy about 30 of the colon remove or the subtotal colectomy about 90 of the colon remove the doctor all seem to suggest the subtotal colectomy if I am positive for lynch but I am a little hesitant to go with such a big surgery as oppose to have the right colectomy with a more aggressive screening process colonoscopy at least annually and potentially chemo as well I know the subtotal colectomy reduce the overall risk that colon cancer will return but there still is a residual risk and it seem like regular screening is an effective approach to identify and remove polyp before they develop and spread to a more advanced stage of cancer in my mind if the aggressive screening process can lower the overall risk that I will have an advanced stage of cancer to a level similar to the subtotal colectomy I would prefer to have the simple surgery up front and not deal with the bowel issue involve with the more complex surgery any thought and or feedback would be appreciate by the way I am a 37 year old male with no significant family history of which I am aware,neutral,0
I do not want to come off as being arrogant but I do not believe that artificial sweetener are as bad as most claim I am not say anyone have to agree with I but I would like to point out a few article some people remain suspicious of all artificial sweetener even though extensive research have not find any significant health concern aspartame sell under the brand name equal and nutrasweet is one of the most test substance ever allow in our food supply its also approve for use in more than 100 other country there s no reason to believe any of the warning fly around the internet that claim aspartame cause alzheimer multiple sclerosis brain damage or any other serious disease and the late research show there s no need to be concerned about cancer last april the national cancer institute release the result of a huge federal study involve more than a half million adult base on that research the institute conclude there is no evidence any artificial sweetener on the market in the you s today is relate to cancer risk in human k so you do not trust the government then consider this the center for science in the public interest the consumer group that have question the safety of aspartame for almost 30 year praise this study say it significantly allay concern about cancer the bottom line is that aspartame is probably safe the center say on its web site product contain aspartame can be harmful to people with phenylketonuria or pku a rare genetic disease so product with aspartame carry a pku warning for everyone else there s nothing to worry about sucralose sell under the brand name splenda is make from sugar that have been chemically engineer to pass through your body without being digest that s why it taste like sugar but is calorie free splenda is now the number one sugar substitute on the market find in salad dressing cereal and beverage as well as those little yellow packet sucralose have been study for a long time say dr john swartzberg head of the editorial board at the uc berkeley wellness letter and there is no evidence of any harm to human being another article aspartame an artificial sweetener distribute under several trade name e g nutrasweet or equal was approve in 1981 by the fda after test show that it do not cause cancer in laboratory animal although not all of the laboratory experiment agree interest in aspartame was renew by a 1996 report suggest that an increase in the number of people with brain tumor between 1975 and 1992 might be associate with the introduction and use of this sweetener in the united states however an analysis of then current nci statistic show that the overall incidence of brain and central nervous system cancer begin to rise in 1973 8 year prior to the approval of aspartame and continue to rise until 1985 moreover increase in overall brain cancer incidence occur primarily in people 70 and old a group that was not expose to the high dose of aspartame since its 1981 introduction these and other datum do not point to a clear link base on animal or human study between the use of aspartame and the development of brain tumor the fda still consider aspartame safe another article like saccharin aspartame is another sweetener that though thoroughly test by the fda and deem safe for the general population have have its share of critic who blame the sweetener for cause everything from brain tumor to chronic fatigue syndrome not so say kava the only people for whom aspartame is a medical problem are those with the genetic condition know as phenylkenoturia pku a disorder of amino acid metabolism those with pku need to keep the level of phenylalanine in the blood low to prevent mental retardation as well as neurological behavioral and dermatological problem since phenylalanine is one of the two amino acid in aspartame people who suffer from pku are advise not to use it if you need to control your sugar and caloric intake artificial sweetener are a safe effective way to do that some people can be sensitive to sweetener and experience symptom such as headache and upset stomach but otherwise there is no credible information that aspartame or any other artificial sweetener cause brain tumor or any other illness say registered dietitian wendy vida with healthplace the health and wellness division of highmark blue cross blue shield in pittsburgh kava say that since sweetener are so much sweet than sugar a very small amount is need to achieve the same sweetness one get from sugar if use normally the amount you take in are so minuscule as to be of no concern at all though there are any number of people quick to point out what they believe are the danger of artificial sweetener other think that they may actually have beneficial property apart from reduce calorie intake and managing diabetes researcher at the oklahoma medical research foundation for example have find in several preliminary study that aspartame is especially effective in relieve pain associate with osteoarthritis multiple sclerosis and sickle cell anemia whether artificial sweetener are show in the future to have therapeutic effect remain to be see say kava for now though their main purpose is to help people reduce caloric intake and or control diabete if you do not need to watch your calorie or your blood sugar there is no real reason to use the sweetener unless you just happen to like the taste say kava but if you need to control your sugar and caloric intake artificial sweetener are a safe effective way to do that,neutral,0

through my health struggle and chronically elevated liver enzyme I want to share this very important information particularly with those who drink a lot of alcohol or even alcohol in moderation I come across a website call www lipoglut com regard a product my doctor is have I take on the front page of this website it state how alcohol and tylenol deplete the glutathione storage in the liver substantially you can do more research on this yourself but what happen to I is that from bloodwork show a very low level of glutathione in my system plus totally miss one of the very important gene in the liver that help to detoxify the liver my liver enzyme are chronically elevate this is because my liver can not remove the toxin properly I am take glutathione or nac to help my liver but I think because I am have allergic reaction to the food that contain glutathione kale broccoli cauliflower brussel sprouts cabbage garlic due to a damage intestinal lining from drink alcohol also I am really have a problem I think I am allergic to sulphur I know as an adult I can not take sulpha drug as I have an allergy to they and this is from a permeable gut lining too so I fully understand now why alcoholic get scarred liver and that is because they have deplete their glutathione level so badly that the liver can not detoxify thing well I have to be careful even when take supplement and make sure that I am take glutathione along with they or my liver can not eliminate the toxin I am curious why no hepatologist will recognize how important glutathione is in heal a person liver I could take regular vitamin today I learn the cow come home and continue to damage my liver because of not have enough glutathione in my system to counteract the effect of the vitamin on my lab it was show 4 year ago I was deficient in b1 b3 folate and glutathione plus many other vitamin unfortunately for I my gall bladder fail and I was not refer to a gi doctor right away so I develop an over growth of yeast fungus in my system so take vitamin especially the b vitamin would really burn in my intestine this burning come from an inflamed and leaky intestinal wall due to drink wine excessively I crave the sugar due to have a chronic candida issue I hope that my research have help those people who are suffer from alcoholism relate liver disease eat plenty of cruciferous vegetable and get some glutathione or nac of course consult with an integrative medicine doctor too about your situation first take care everyone,negative,-1

this is a very basic site I come across while look previous info on protein intake contradictory argument for against it is short to the point may help some new member with basic fact this is from the website canadian liver foundation I do not ever post article nor do I particularily like read they as sometimes as my gi would say way too much information but after read the late post specifically maggie craig theory on nutrition and so on for what it is worth I tend to agree w both of they I think I would pass this along as I am a firm believer in proper nutritional logical maintenance of oneself in what you consume and how you live attitude mindset is 1 2 the battle so anyhow if this help anyone in any small way then just puttin it out there so to speak manage liver disease through nutrition it is vitally important that patient with liver disease maintain a balanced diet one which ensure adequate calorie carbohydrate fat and protein such a diet will aid the liver in the regeneration of liver cell nutrition that support this regeneration is a means of treatment of some liver disorder patient with cirrhosis for example who are malnourished require a diet rich in protein and provide 2 000 3 000 calorie per day to help the liver re build itself however some cirrhotic patient have protein intolerance too much protein will result in an increase amount of ammonia in the blood while too little protein can reduce healing of the liver doctor must carefully prescribe a specific amount of protein that will not elevate the blood ammonia lactulose and neomycin are two drug that help keep the ammonia down it is believe that the risk of gallbladder disorder can be reduce by avoid high fat and cholesterol food and prevent obesity the gallbladder is a storage sac for the bile produce by the liver during digestion the gallbladder release bile into the small intestine through the common bile duct most gallbladder problem are cause by gallstone and 80 90 of all gallstone are produce from excessive cholesterol which crystallize and form stone by maintain a well balanced diet and avoid high cholesterol intake the incidence of gallstone formation may be lower when are specific diet restriction require beyond the maintenance of a good well balanced diet several condition that develop in the later stage of cirrhosis require specific dietary management hepatic encephalopathy hepatic encephalopathy is a condition of impaired mental function due to altered liver function it is often see when scar tissue formation cirrhosis in the liver prevent the normal flow of blood through the liver the blood which contain toxin is shunt or redirect back to the central circulation and into the brain without first go through the liver for detoxification cirrhosis with portal hypertension an elevation of the portal pressure due to the obstruction of blood flow through the liver may be treat surgically by shunt some of the blood around the liver connect the portal system with the systematic circulation this shunt blood contain high concentration of amino acid and ammonia and probably other as yet unidentified toxic substance that may cause alter mental function in some patient the treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is aim at reduce toxin that cause this disorder just as patient with cirrhosis who have protein intolerance must restrict protein intake so must patient with hepatic encephalopathy reduce the amount of protein in their diet severe protein restriction to 20 gram a day or less is impractical for long term therapy most physician will encourage their patient to take approximately 40 gram of protein a day and will prescribe lactulose and neomycin to decrease the production of ammonia in the intestine certain specific amino acid hepatamine may be less likely to cause hepatic encephalopathy and have even been suggest as therapy certain food vegetable milk contain protein rich in these amino acid and are prefer to meat as a source of protein in affect patient a dietary supplement rich in these amino acid hepatic aid is available and is in use in many liver centre ascite and edema ascite is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity edema is fluid build up in the tissue usually the foot leg or back both condition result from abnormal accumulation of sodium associate with portal hypertension and liver disease most affected patient will not require strict fluid restriction sodium intake is often restrict for patient with cirrhosis to avoid retention of fluid in the body such a diet would allow only 2 4 gram of sodium and would exclude can soup and vegetable cold cut meat condiment such as mayonnaise and ketchup dairy product cheese and that is cream most fresh food are low in sodium the good salt substitute is lemon juice which is salt free cholestasis cholestasis is an inability of the liver to excrete bile this may result in steatorrhea fat malabsorption due to inadequate amount of bile which dissolve fat in the intestine steatorrhea may go unnoticed by the patient or can be associate with weight loss due to lose calorie stool may be foul smell and float fat supplement are available the most commonly use being medium chain triglyceride mct oil and safflower oil which are absorbable with less dependence upon bile they may be use as a caloric supplement mct oil is use like any other cook oil in salad dressing or in cook patient with steatorrhea may also have difficulty absorb fat soluble vitamin however water soluble vitamin are absorb normally supplement the diet with fat soluble vitamin is possible though it should only be carry out under the guidance of a physician wilson disease in wilson disease there is a defect in copper metabolism patient affect by this disorder have an abnormal build up of copper in the body due to the inability of the liver to excrete it this inability allow the copper to accumulate in several organ first the liver and then usually the brain and the cornea of the eye treatment involve the use of a de copper agent penicillamine which remove the excess copper from the body dietary therapy for this disease include the avoidance of copper contain food like chocolate nuts shellfish and mushroom hemochromatosis hemochromatosis is a disease in which there is an inappropriate absorption of iron from the intestine the excessive iron then accumulate in the liver pancrea and other organ in the body patient with this disease should not be give iron supplement aside from this precaution those with hemochromatosis may follow a normal diet treatment is achieve by frequent removal of blood from a large vein fatty liver fatty liver is relate to alcohol obesity starvation some drug and other factor it is not cause by eat fat and it should be treat with a well balanced diet or the removal of the responsible chemical substance or drug finally patient with liver disease should be wary of supplement to the diet particularly fad food or package nutritional aid such food can contain a lot of salt potassium or inappropriate protein mixture those that are safe should be take only under a physician guidance,neutral,0

risk factor for develop copd include environmental hazard such as cigarette smoke or work in environment that lung damage is likely to occur age most case of copd are diagnose after the age of 40 as this is a disease that progress slowly and genetic just like some people are able to smoke from the time they are 14 until they are 85 with no real ill effect other people find that after ten year of smoking they are face serious consequence genetic play a huge role in who is affect and who is spare I know this subject have come up time and time again but I feel it is something that should be push and push so I am go to push it one more time test can be run for patient experience copd symptom combine with a health history point to the likelihood for a clear diagnosis copd can often be diagnose before symptom begin with the use of a pulmonary function test a chest x ray an arterial blood gas analysis a sputum examination and a ct scan can usually reveal enough information to determine the condition of the lung complication can result from copd include high blood pressure chronic or frequent respiratory infection heart problem lung cancer and depression patient experience copd should follow the physician outline for treatment as closely as possible to decrease the risk of further illness there is no cure for copd treatment option focus in make the patient more comfortable and dispel any further damage to the lung the most important key factor to survive copd is smoke cessation medication that help open the airways pain medication and medication to help fight off infection are all part of the treatment plan however if the patient continue to smoke there is little chance that the physician will be able to do anything to prolong life or enhance the quality of life jame,neutral,0

so when I was dxd with lyme in 2007 I think it was after go through every other test imaginable my doc convince my I have leukemia and so on my wbc was high month after month and they could not find a reason or source for it at it is high it was about 15 000 I go to the hospital last week about 4 am wednesday morning because my heart rate while lay in bed was 130 and I was getting very disorient I have grave disease hyperthyroid as well but have been medicate treat for over 5 year now now my thyroid is high than it was in the beginning of my symptom and I am being super medicated for my heart and thyroid leave I zombifie right now it all the blood work they are many abnormality high platelet high glucose low iron and very high white blood count at 21 000 the first doctor on staff was so concerned he want to admit I think I have some horrible infection 3 day later and massive amount of blood culture take they find nothing normally I know well than to bring up lyme because that gets knock down quickly but I mention it as it is an infection that can cause many of my symptom and blood work they would not even do a lyme test at my request that was pretty stupid if you ask I I think maybe that if I get dxd again with lyme the stupid doctor that they are would automatically treat I as a new case new tick and maybe my insurance would pay for the iv treatment again hey I can dream right I am just stuck and do not know what to do there is no help if you can not afford it because insurance company rule the world or at least america obviously my body is scream that something is wrong no one will listen or try to help I got discharge with amoxicillin because they recognize that something have to be wrong somewhere whatever it is my new attitude about everything whatever it is just too frustrating to deal with anymore sorry just have to vent it out,negative,-1

so if my memory is correct it is now 5 year to the day that I have routine surgery for suspect appendicitis which turn out to be cancer in my appendix at the time they do not say it was cancer just suspect about 3 week later they confirm it as cancer and tell I I have colon cancer so the sweet part of this is that it is 5 year later and my colon is clear of cancer the bitter part is that by the time of the surgery my appendix have burst and the cancer get into my abdominal cavity and but could not be see there at the time as my appendix have probably only burst a with the previous few day and so there were no discernible tumour I have 6 month of chemo and during one of my 6 monthly review a junior oncologist say they do not expect the cancer to come back what they do not tell I but write in my note was they suspect pmp this is a rare form of cancer that start in the appendix and unless catch early spread to the abdominal cavity so mid july 2009 I am tell they have see something on the ct scan sure enough I have pmp I get surgery in at a specialist centre at the start of 2010 search for moas cancer to get an idea of what surgery I have 18 month later I am tell that they see something on the ct scan this time it is in a place where they can not operate without risk of kill I during the surgery on the plus side it was probably there when they do the surgery in 2010 and so is very slow grow right now I am ski at sunday river for the season at teach skiing to people with disability and basically get on with my life rather than let cancer run my life I would be lie if I do not say that I have not play the what if game like report a strange symptom 6 month early what if they have operate a day early but most of the time I go and ski for as long as I can I am not go to let this cancer affect my life,neutral,0

by dr suzanne delamonte I will paraphrase part of this and use actual quote from her article for the rest our offsite advisor think it might make a great topic for we I agree the link to the two disease are fascinating although wea ve always know that alzheimera s disease is typically associate with numerous tangle and plaque in the brain the exact cause of these abnormality have been hard to pin down now we may be close to an answer in many respect alzheimera s is a brain form of diabetes even in the early stage of disease the braina s ability to metabolize sugar is reduce normally insulin play a big role in help the brain take up sugar from the blood but in alzheimera s insulin is not very effective in the brain consequently the brain cell practically starve to death as diabetic we are twice as likely to get alzheimer both disease are surge with countless people being diagnose each year alzhemer was once think to be genetic but study have show that is not always the case what could be cause these case number to explode could diabetes and alzheimera s be cause by some type of exposure we have reasonable evidence that human exposure to nitrosamine is at the root cause of not only alzheimera s but several other insulin resistance disease include type 2 diabetes fatty liver disease also know as nash and visceral obesity the elimination of local farm in favor of mega farm require transport of food for long distance to prolong shelf life preservative are add the problem is worsen with transport of a fresha food from across the pacific ocean nitrite are add to meat and process food for flavor and color high level of nitrate add to fertilizer can be incorporate into produce and then convert to nitrites and finally nitrosamine in the body nitrosamine contaminate many process food include fish cheese hotdogs ground beef smoke meat like bacon smoke turkey and ham and beer originally nitrite were add to food as preservative to prevent salmonella infection from contaminated meet the policy remain in place although effort have been make to reduce the level nitrite are still add as preservative over time western society particularly in the us have been chronically expose to increase amount of nitrosamine due to continuous consumption of process food nitrosamine are well recognize cancer cause agent in high dose they cause cancer in many organ one of the main toxin in tobacco is a nitrosamine however low chronic exposure have cumulative effect year ago a few scientist suggest that nitrosamine might cause diabete the concept was not pursue until now we perform experiment in the laboratory and show that very low limited exposure to nitrosamine the type find in food cause alzheimera s type brain degeneration dementia diabete fatty liver disease and obesity add high fat to the diet make the disease cause effect of nitrosamine much bad I know we are what we eat this article was stunning though I have hear argument that nitrate find in our food are at safe level really then why are so many of we sick,neutral,0

I do not even know where to begin and I am sure my story is go to come out somewhat convoluted but here it go I just join this support group last night because my boyfriend of 5 year die on wednesday afternoon in the end he was diagnose with terminal lung cancer which have spread to 4 other spot in his body to make a long story short my boyfriend was apparently aware that he have cancer and never tell anyone I was actually tell that he know he have cancer even before we meet which I am unsure is the truth or not in the final 6 8 month of his life I do suspect know something serious was go on and pressure he to see a doctor over and over again my bf continue to tell I that he was and that the doctor could not figure out the cause of his symptom even look back at the journal he have write here on ds from early september there was no obvious indication that he have any awareness of the fact that he have cancer we I continue to make plan for the future and to have the usual disagreement about why he do not want to get marry or why he would not make the commitment to do a permanent move to be with I yes our relationship was somewhat of a long distance one however in the past 3 year he was more with I and my family than in his own place he continue to travel to be with we my family up until the last few week of his life despite what I can only imagine would be immeasurable pain and the fact that all he do most of the time he was with we was sleep during his last visit he was definitely act much strange than usual throw money around talk about how he have leave I in his will and so on he also get one last sudden burst of energy to do some thing that he know would make I happy the last day he was here with I was dec 05 the next day after he return home he tell everyone include I that the reason for his sudden and massive weight loss was that he was try to commit slow suicide by not eat he also tell I in a round about way that he have lung cancer by state that there have been chest x ray do and the doctor discover a small spot on his lung which need to be check far he then stop take essential med that were prescribe for another illness completely hole himself up in his bedroom and wait to die I guess this was an easy out for he since any other way it would be discover that he have cancer I become very concerned and contact his brother who reluctantly go to check on he however after see he immediately take he to the hospital I do go to see he in the hospital and even then he was still in some denial and insistent that he was go to be with I for christmas once it was discover that he have tumor that they were go to check out I was immediately give the bum rush by his family and send packing although he decline really quickly in the ensue day my bf continue to ask why I was not with he when I call and ask other people why I was not there I am not certain why I was not tell the reason but his family decide that I was not to see he or be near he before his death I was give 5 minute to say good bye my child and grandchild never have a chance to say any good bye at all the situation was a bit nuts in the end and I feel like a little child who was tell she was bad and could not see her good friend any long rather than a 43 year old woman who was deeply in love with a 58 year old man I feel angry with he for not have prepare thing a bit well as well as for not being treat as a vital part of his life I love he and they just could not open their eye to see that I would have want nothing more than to be able to grieve openly along side his blood family however instead my family and I have only one another there is no one here console we for our loss,negative,-1

in may 2007 when my beloved husband was first diagnose with aml at the age of 63 we do not really have enough time to consider treatment option the referring oncologist in the city where we live call to say you need to go up to uab hospital now to start chemo it was only during his first induction chemo that we were able to research the masse of information available on line being in a university hospital it was difficult to develop a relationship with any one consultant or the ever change team of doctor and nurse and when some of the doctor do stop long enough to answer our many question differ opinion add confusion my husband survive the initial aggressive induction but we were totally unprepared for the period of neutropenia that follow it he was very sick and express that the treatment would probably kill he before leukemia do three considation treatment follow and each time his recovery become more difficult and dehumanising in cr by that time my husband decide not to have a 4th consolidation as recommend by his consulting oncologist who have manage his case at the hospital op clinic my husband was bless with 15 month in remission I stop work so that we could live life to the full knowing that the prognosis for people over 60 is not positive and that the cancer could return anytime richard decide that when that time come he would not undergo a second induction and would choose palliative therapy he want to die with dignity and not in a hospital from the toxic side effect of chemical and neuropenia on 23 november 2008 follow a rountine blood check we become accutely aware that something was not right the consultatant was nearly 2 hour late for our appointment my husband was anxious and impatient and complain about the wait when the consultant finally do arrive he berate my husband as if he were a child and say you have to learn to suck this up if you do not then I would not be your consultant anymore he then procede to tell we the bad news and order my husband immediate admission into hospital we decide to go home and think about what to do next and to spend thanksgive with family I still do not know why my husband change his mind about not undergo a further induction but he do this time even more aggressive than the first they call it salvage chemo like clean up after a wreck but none of the doctor could tell we what would happen after this because the outcome are unpredicatable and different for each individual nine day later on 11 12 08 my husband heart stop beat that morning he have been tell that he have contact clostridium difficile despite all the antibiotic antifungal and antiviral medication he have been receive post chemo and that this was what was make he so sick he was admit to the icu where he die in the early hour of 12 12 08 follow a second mi richard have no history of heart problem and an ekg prior to start chemo was normal the percentage of blast in his bone marrow were just 23 prior to start chemo what I am really struggle with is whether my husband death was a good death what would have happen if he have follow a supportive or palliative option rather than the empiric treatment could he have leave this world in a more gentle way at home or hospice do anybody have story to tell that might answer these question and perhaps offer a hopeful alternative to people whose prognosis is not as good as say a young healthy person nothing can bring back my beloved husband but I have a need to know as part of contain my grief and understanding well the treatment choice for this terrible disease,negative,-1

hello I am new to this site and search for answer are not we all 5 week ago my partner was diagnose with sclc the tumor is in his upper left lung and have spread to his liver the doctor also say there were some very small lesion in his brain but not to be concern with that they are so small he would rather treat the tumor itself first aggressive chemo therapy start the following week the first day for 3 hrs then 1 hour each for the next two day last week we meet with the doctor before start the second round of chemo x ray show the upper left lung have collapse and develop a hole we were in emergency within an hour the hole was locate in scar tissue was seal with talc and that part of the lung was staple off his lung is now at 99 inflation without oxygen his o2 saturation level is 95 with o2 his saturation is 100 but his sodium level is very low 115 120 we are do everything we can think of to increase that by limit free water and have a high sodium diet his white blood cell count is high also the doctor feel this is because of the talc that was use say it is a foreign substance in his body and the white blood cell count should level out soon during chemo his experience was very good no nausea feeling and so on all of his hair fall out 3 week after the first round the man have a very good attitude about the disease want to recover quickly and have never been down I think this is because his mother is a 21 year survivor of breast cancer and a 5 year survivor of a double lung transplant his sister is a 9 year survivor of leukemia that pass through the brain barrier he feel he can do it too but this is so new to I I are wonder if I am miss something should he and I be get a second opinion what should we be look out for what more can I be do to make he comfortable he is home now after 1 week in the hospital we will be have a home health nurse and respiratory therapist start in a few day I would like to hear from anyone with idea or suggestion we are in portland oregon and willing to change hospital and doctor if necessary any recomendation,neutral,0
cholesterol information should not be so vague I am have difficulty complete a regiment I feel should not be so complex I complete two cholesterol test six week apart almost a year ago a week before my second test a nurse call to tell I I have a test for cholesterol originally I understand it as a completely different appointment for a completely different issue and say it was just routine because I have an elevated cholesterol level one month after the test I was tell to take a statin and my number were in range at tc 167 hdl 48 ldl 103 trig 81 by a nurse when I ask what the number mean I receive the result via letter I ask the following month about how long it take to finish the medication I was tell long time but I could try to decrease the dosage if I was interested but it was so low to start that it would be almost pointless and I would have to come back for more test my doctor state that once I complete my cholesterol treatment we may continue with any other issue I discover he also do not know how long nor have any target number ask on multiple occasion I was tell to make some change since I was at 167 so I I switch from 2 1 milk white rice a brown rice chicken a fish 3hrs a 8hrs of exercise trade all vacation and sick time to work out cancel all children after school activity due to logistic of work out eat more fruit and oatmeal but have to change job to accommodate the extra bathroom break I am also have more difficulty gain weight after the change I was tell my next cholesterol test could be sometime next year 2 in 2011 1 in 2013 how often is normal 1 how long do it take to get rid of cholesterol I was tell it is an art not a science 2 can I reasonably expect completion before I am 43 just turn 42 3 how high do cholesterol level typically spike for test 4 how much weight can I expect to gain use a cholesterol diet a lot of this cholesterol stuff sound make up and I am about to give up but I do want to give it an honest attempt because I do not go to medical school and I assume this is for my own good by the way this is the long I have ever take a medication I have take approximately 262 20 mg as of today,neutral,0

ok this have probably been post a million time but do these symptom sound like what some of you have experience if the symptom continue to get bad I will for sure go to a doctor the reason I do not now is that I have terrible insurance and of course can not afford do procedure just to put my mind at ease so here are my symptom stool are become thin not pencil thin but noticeably thin than normal stool come out in piece sometimes they are flat and very small other time they are normal size but with a long indent make they more flat red blood speck on the stool and on the toilet paper this usually get bad after the 2nd bowel movement of the day make I think the problem is just a hemorrhoid in the anus but this have been go on for about 2 month no itching or burn I have also have a long red strip very mucoussy stool I have bad acid reflux so this may be the reason for that incomplete stool I can tell there is still some stuff leave in there but can not get at it pretty gross stool always have speck of food in it I figure this is from the high fiber diet or the acid reflux medicine could it be from my colon not process the food because of an ailment nausea feel every now and then terrible gas I have always have bad gas but it seem to be get bad could be all the veggie though stomach gurgle really loudly for about 10 minute after eat about myself I am pretty healthy I eat a ton of fiber lot of fruit and vegetable I walk or run everyday I do have really bad acid reflux which run in my family I have been take priolsec the off brand anyway every day for the last few month I am under a fair amount of stress and use to suffer from panic attack but have have that under control for awhile I am only 25 so I can not believe it would be colon cancer but you never know not sure about family history of colon cancer I guess I am just try to get reassurance that I would not be waste money do the combination of these symptom justify go to the doctor should I go straight to a gi or do I have to get a referral from a gp first thank,neutral,0

august 27 2007 will forever be etch into my mind not only was it my mom 63rd birthday but I have just find out my mom patty gottlieb have stage iv lung cancer nsclc and of course I was beyond devastate she assume it was stage 3 which can still be cure and was so excited by the news the thoracic surgeon nurse say kerri your mom do not ask what stage it was so I do not tell she she will find out soon enough I call my father and we along with my brother decide to let the doctor tell she when we go for the next appointment it was the hard few day of my life not being able to share my agony and profound devastation with the one person who always understand my mom from my limited knowledge on the subject I was sure her death was imminent we would lose she in a few month and I know I would not be able to handle that she is one of my good friend both of my brother have kid but I just got marry 2 year ago my husband and I were plan on get a house and start have kid next year cause there was not any rush all of a sudden all I could think of was oh my god my child will never know the most amazing woman mother wife grandmother and friend that I have ever know and that was just unacceptable to I but then I remember two very important thing she and my father always teach we kid knowledge is power and you must be your own advocate she was mine when I was in sloane kettering at age 12 after experience pain and other symptom and being tell by our orthopedist that it was grow pain my parent do not just ignore my complaint and eventually we end up at sloane kettere the doctor at sloane find a tumor in my tibia bone they were sure it was bone cancer and all the test show it have spread but when they do a biopsy they find the tumor and remove it instead after test and find only some malignant cell they were shocked and could not explain why it have not so I am a case at the mayo clinic for the unexplained medical phenomena one thing they were sure of though was that if my mom have not persist on my behalf I would have definitely lose my leg if not my life the only scar I have is about an inch and look like a shaving scar crazy right so I go into researcher mode and find a ton of information through some great book website booklet article and support group so when she do find out 4 day later that her cancer could go into remission but would never be cure I was ready I show her story of people with her same illness that now have been live for 5 10 even 15 year with stage iv lung cancer she say the great gift I give she that day was hope so when my family and friend especially my mom and dad tell I how amazing I have been in help she it is only because she teach I how and because of the lung cancer alliance support board I remember that doctor are great and statistic are fine but doctor do not know everything and statistic are just number you must have faith if you believe you ll get well and fight for it I think you can definitely beat the odd and that is what I am pray for not only for my little patty a nickname since she is 5 foot and I am 58 laugh out loud but for everyone with cancer and also everyone at memorial sloane kettering cancer hospital in new york city have been so truly amazing throughout everything from her initial diagnosis to even make sure the insurance company pay the bill it is about 6000 just for each chemo treatment crazy right we think about go to the sloane kettering facility mercy hospital or one of the other long island facility but hear mixed review I pull aside the head nurse of the chief of thoracic surgery at sloane in new york city and ask she if it was her mom would she trek all the way in to the city or go the easy route and stay close to home she say without a doubt she would trek to the city to give she mom the good care with the good specialist my parent brother and I all agree and we take turn go in whenever possible but for the most part it is I my amazing hubby mike and my parent it is been tough because she recently break her ankle and now is in bed with a cast my dad and I do pretty well most day but it is hard when we get overwhelmed I try to remember how my mom must feel she is always been so strong and independent I can not fathom how out of control she must feel it really do give you an amazing feeling help other especially love one I finally understand why people donate so much of their time to great cause it feel great to give back you almost get more out of it than those you help,very negative,-2

vitamin e may be of help in common liver disease over the year the medicinal quality of vitamin e have been both praise and criticize for decade there have been a debate whether this vitamin could prevent cancer or heart disease large study have pretty much determine that cancer and heart disease do not respond to vitamin e supplementation for that reason many physician incorrectly believe that vitamin e treatment is worthless for any purpose for example a recent study in the new england of medicine have show vitamin e to be of great use in the treatment of a common liver disease result from fat accumulation in the liver steatosis the liver normally store some fat but in excess it can lead to inflammation of the liver a condition call steatohepatitis in up to 15 of those with steatohepatitis cirrhosis and liver failure can result steatohepatitis itself is relatively common in my endocrinology practice several patient per day show evidence of this liver disease manifest as abnormality on routine liver blood test patient most likely to show characteristic abnormality on liver blood test are those with high cholesterol particularly if take the cholesterol lower medication know as statin diabetes and obesity if the blood test are particularly abnormal an ultrasound of the liver is usually obtain to be sure nothing else is occur such as liver cancer or cirrhosis simple steatosis itself is generally easy to diagnose on the ultrasound a recent study in the new england journal of medicine volume 362 no 18 demonstrate that vitamin e is beneficial for treat steatohepatitis 247 subject with evidence of steatohepatitis not due to alcohol use or diabetes were give various treatment the group get 800 iu vitamin e per day show a 43 improvement in measure of steatohepatitis also examine as a possible treatment for steatohepatitis was actos pioglitazone a popular diabetes drug although the result with actos were promise they were not as good as the result with vitamin e as always the researcher conclude that further study will be need to confirm this benefit before use vitamin e in your own program be sure to check with your physician first vitamin e can act like a blood thin so its use in people who have bleed abnormality or on drug that influence blood clotting is of particular concern this article is for educational purpose only and is not intend as medical advice the disclaimer for metabolism com apply to this and all my post gary pepper m d editor in chief metabolism com one response to common liver disease respond to vitamin e 1 clinical nutritionist on may 18th 2010 at 9 20 prime minister hi i d like to add a few more important point about vitamin e vitamin e in its natural state is actually 8 different compound tocopherol and tocotrienol many of the medical clinical study only use alpha tocopherol and often they use the inferior synthetic version dl alpha tocopherol so realistically vitamin have not been study adequately or appropriately the word tocopherol in greek translate into to bring forth offspring and we know vitamin e is important in fertility it is also of primary importance in prevent oxidation of cholesterol and also the fatty acid in cell membrane vitamin e also regenerate vitamin c and therefore is crucial to our antioxidant status so there is a little tidbit about vitamin e more to come later beth ellen diluglio miss rd cnsd ccn ld and,neutral,0

hi newbie here in browse the internet last night I find something interesting and just want to post it here gluten and casein as factor responsible for the characteristic disease of chronic hepatitis c not everyone expose to hcv develop a chronic infection the rate of natural clearance is unknown because most people are not aware they are infect until the condition become chronic one know factor in chronic infection with viral hepatitis a b is selenium deficiency in malnourished population celiac disease the most easily diagnose form of gluten toxicity is know to cause selenium deficiency in well feed population celiac also cause a general deficiency of many antioxidant protein and mineral and vitamin there is a strong association between hcv and celiac disease in many population test there is an even strong association between interferon alpha treatment and celiac disease interferon alpha is the cytokine that trigger celiac disease naturally celiac disease is only the easy to diagnose of the gluten sensitivity syndrome it result in destruction of the intestinal cell vilii damage which can be detect on biopsy even so celiac is seriously underdiagnosed it is likely that anyone in new zealand with the symptom of celiac disease who is hcv positive will be tell that their symptom are due to hepatitis c testing for celiac will happen slowly and most likely not at all unless the patient insist and test for other form of gluten sensitivity is unlikely milder form of gluten sensitivity might only disrupt those gut receptor responsible for function such as immune regulation especially endorphin receptor mineral transport or absorption of specific vitamin antibody may form to the proline rich gluten gliadin and casein sequence release by peptide digestion which enter the bloodstream which then attack the proline rich collagenous tissue promote disease such as liver fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis it so happen that the auto immune symptom associate with celiac and gluten sensitivity disease include liver and gall bladder disease and which usually resolve slowly on a strict gluten and dairy free diet are essentially identical to the various syndrome see in chronic hep c especially during or after interferon alpha treatment syndrome cause by gluten in celiac disease include fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver gall bladder obstruction insulin resistance thyroiditis sicca syndrome dry eye and mouth vasculitis brain fog poor memory confusion depression fibromyalgia fatigue optic neuritis deficiency of selenium magnesium zinc chromium deficiency of fat soluble vitamin a d e k deficiency of those vitamin convert in the intestine include folate b6 anaemia thrombocytopenic purpurea low platelet due to autoimmunity gi disturbance diarrhea steatorrhea these symptom are aggravate by the nutrient deficiency especially antioxidant magnesium and chromium deficiency associate with gluten sensitivity in fact the symptom of both hep c and celiac disease are often partially but significantly relive by supplementation of these nutrient especially when anti inflammatory botanical curcumin grape seed ginkgo milk thistle and so on are add other treatment effective against hep c have obvious link to gluten sensitivity for example low dose naltrexone may exert its beneficial effect on cancer autoimmune disease and viral immunity by repair damage do to endorphin receptor by gluten and casein digest similarly enzyme therapy for cancer may work by promote the complete digestion of gluten and casein exorphin and the ketogenic diet for cancer may work by eliminate grain and lower insulin level and hence inflammation rather than merely by deprive cancer cell of glucose exorphin are chemical find in protein digest the peptide produce by pepsin digestion of food protein which have an affinity for endorphin receptor endorphin are the messenger of emotion and gluten sensitivity is very often find in schizophrenia autism adhd asperger and the various mood disorder however the endorphin system also regulate the immune system and defect of endorphin and endorphin receptor are associate with cancer and autoimmune disease as well as aid endorphin also regulate gut motility the well know constipate effect of cheese is an opioid effect even people who have no gluten antibody and no leaky gut which allow gluten digest to enter the bloodstream in especially large dose are influence by the opioid effect of exorphin at the local gut level diagnose non celiac gluten and casein sensitivity without exclusion diet is difficult if not impossible commonly in new zealand a scratch test for gluten is the doctora s first choice this is bad than useless because we are not talk about an allergy to gluten at all though these do exist when gluten milk and maize are digest in the stomach by pepsin and hydrochloric acid a variety of peptide are release the exact combination of peptide that might appear in the gut vary with the individual the state of his digestion and the strain of wheat milk or maize consume gliadomorphin is a characteristic wheat exorphin beta casomorphin 7 is think to be the most toxic milk exorphin and the maize exorphin have not yet been identify autoimmune reaction to antigenic peptide is not the only way in which exorphin can harm we so the current insistence on immunological testing seem limited also current test do not include antibody to every possible peptide digest of gluten this would probably be impossible luckily no one need to eat grain our ancestor get along in well health without they for million of year grain consumption is a comparatively recent phenomenon in human history very recent indeed in some case in northern europe and in colonized oceania it is a habit of mere century if that in part of the world where grain eating go back long for example the eastern mediterranean there is a high rate of adaptation this do not mean that individual adapt to grain individual die young or become sterile if they lack the more grain adapt gene in order that the race might adapt but this still do not rule out the disease of late life study of remain of grain dependent society such as rome and ancient egypt show that so call a moderna disease such as arthritis and cancer were prolific there it is trendy to think that such disease result from technology radiation pesticide food processing and that it can be prevent with an organic vegetarian diet the sad truth is that in most case wheat and milk even organic wheat and milk a product of the old agricultural revolution a are do more harm than those trace of the modern industrial revolution that we can not avoid if our immune system and our detox enzyme can not cope with some new agricultural chemical the most likely reason is the disruption they have receive from the old agricultural chemical a gluten and casein it was also agriculture not food processing that first place man in a guilty relationship with his food pre agricultural man kill to eat and take from the forest and have ritual that make peace with the animal and the plant he take from these bounteous god not from captive creature agricultural man kill for money pay other to kill for he and burn down the forest to plant his cash crop if this was original sin then the wage of sin have indeed been death it is customary to blame lead pipe for the decline of rome the roman people were highly wheat addict they would riot for bread a bread and circusesa was the formula for keep they happy they were so addicted that the state find it more convenient to supply bread for free like a methadone clinic for the opiate of the people today the state oversee the addition of gluten milk and maize to an ever widen range of food so that a mere bread shortage is not likely to cause withdrawal this is probably not intentional addict tend to assume that everyone want to share their habit in the case of rome wheat and lead may have have a synergistic toxicity both lead poisoning and wheat consumption tend to reduce iron and zinc absorption this is why celiac child are often of short stature the romans would have become increasingly incapable of sensible planning and come to lack the stern old roman self control we know that a decrease birthrate of a true borna romans eventually lead to the conscription of barbarian army and the opening up of roman citizenship today gluten and the antioxidant deficiency it cause is a major cause of infertility research have been do into the link between gluten sensitivity and hep c show a strong association especially after interferon therapy there is also a strong association between hep c and lymphoma a cancer of the lymph gland lymphoma is the characteristic cancer cause by gluten celiac have a 30x elevated risk of lymphoma to date no one seem to have test a strict gluten and dairy free diet for chronic hep c or post interferon toxicity but a great many people with hep c who take their health seriously have gone gluten free often without know of the link between the two condition but motivate by their own well being when avoiding gluten there is no nutritional need that can only be meet by grain nut and seed for example supply the same amino acid fat and vitamin in great concentration for example sunflower and sesame seed are superior source of methionine and vitamin e while legume are rich in complex carbohydrate gluten is also a cause of insulin resistance and everyone who develop liver fibrosis have some degree of insulin resistance gluten itself cause a four fold rise in insulin level unusual for a protein the cure for insulin resistance is two fold a high protein low carb diet the paleolithic diet is the most natural version of this diet and replacement of the nutrient deplete by gluten which are essential for the function of insulin receptor chromium magnesium and the antioxidant mineral and vitamin gluten also seem to cause amino acid deficiency include some of the very amino acid which wheat is suppose to supply methionine and cysteine gluten is very much an anti nutrient once one is sensitive to it recommend reading on gluten

hi all my dad start have some back pain in september last year since he is been smoke since his teen year and he is 74 now the immediate suspicion was lung cancer however a biopsy make at the time find no issue last january since no other explanation was give to the pain he go through another biopsy which also find no problem then thing start turn bad he have a broken femur the surgery to get it fix was quite successful but thing have been clearly deteriorate since then he is lose weight and he was already quite thin he feel weak and he have to use diaper the bone was break due to a metastasis that is also on his other leg and his rib yesterday he go through radiotherapy for the first time and he also have take zometa which should strengthen the bone we were happy that the treatment actually start but today he was extremely weak and we have to take he to the hospital where they find out he was dehydrate anyway I wonder if any of you have go through a similar situation and can answer some of the follow question we do not know yet if it is sc or nsc this should be answer by the biopsy and due to that the oncologist currently refuse to give we any estimation before see the result but from what I read and also from the comment that the gp have make in the hospital today I am afraid he might be close to a terminal state right he have almost no problem breathe could it be that it is not lung cancer at all accord to the oncologist it should most likely be due to the type of cancer cell find in his leg carcinoma is there any hope that he will walk again currently he is not allow to walk since his leg are fragile anyone have experience with zometa I read somewhere in the web that it do not seem to help that much he have also difficulty close his right hand and he is lose strength movement on it the oncologist have dismiss it as arthritis or something similar but after read the forum I am afraid it could be due to the tumor reach the brain anyone have similar experience is it common that the biopsy fail to find the tumor I am so that it take we this long to start a proper treatment and to make matter bad I do not like the oncologist attitude at all well that was a huge post I hope anyone have the patience to read it and can shed some light on the situation needless to say it is been some tough day especially since I live abroad and should go back to work soon thank and good regard marcos,neutral,0

I find this very interesting and informative you should read it if you have a minute or two hepatitis c the disease no one talk about http www statesmanjournal com alan gustafson the statesman journal the disease is a silent epidemic that is get little public attention state official say ann shindo take to task the federal government for fail to confront hepatitis c in oregon and across the country remember when reagan do not say aid that is where we are with hep c say shindo the coordinator of viral hepatitis prevention for the oregon department of human service it is like 1988 pal and no one talk about hep c we have four time as many people nationwide live with hep c as hiv the virus that cause aid and we have no federal fund and state fund to address this epidemic the national center for disease control and prevention estimate that nearly 2 percent of all americans more than 4 million people are infect with hepatitis c it kill about 10 000 people per year each year there are anywhere from 20 000 to 30 000 new infection accord to the federal agency often call the silent epidemic hepatitis c can hibernate in the liver for decade often take 20 to 30 year before symptom surface shindo say an estimate 65 000 oregonian have hepatitis c and most of they do not know they are carry it for some it is a devastating potentially lethal time bomb the reality is someone may be clean and sober for 25 year then find out they have hep c and it dramatically change their life shindo say that is a very common story it can detrimentally impact people live to the point of lose their job lose their home and become homeless hepatitis c is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood the most common way it is transmit is by the sharing of needle by drug user which account for nearly 70 percent of new infection there is no vaccine for hepatitis c the virus was not identify until 1989 and testing was not available until 1992 for unknown reason the majority of people with hepatitis c would not develop severe symptom or need treatment but about one in five among the chronically infect will develop life threaten complication such as cancer cirrhosis and liver failure hepatitis c is the lead cause of liver transplant in the you s of the 18 000 americans wait for a transplant an estimate 40 percent to 60 percent have hepatitis c far complicate matter is the tricky business of treatment shindo say antiviral medication for hepatitis c is expensive often cause severe side effect and fail to eradicate the virus in about half of all patient treatment generally is not recommend for those without liver damage but regular monitoring is see as crucial for everyone with hepatitis c educate a poorly inform public about the harsh reality of hepatitis c pose an uphill fight shindo and other activist say it is a highly stigmatize disease shindo say people believe oh it is just drug injection drug user who get it in oregon city a nonprofit advocacy organization call the hepatitis c care ambassador program is try to pump up the volume about the silent epidemic as it stand now lorren sandt the program director say most people do not know what hepatitis c is because there is a lack of education and awareness also there is a shortage of testing that is available within the public health department shindo hold the news media partly to blame for widespread lack of know ledge about hepatitis c I think there is a lot of mythology and just cluelessness around this epidemic nationwide she say and part of the reason for that is there is been a lack of medium coverage and a lack of funding for folk like I to get out there and address all the high risk folk that need to be address shindo job is fund by the cdc which pay for hepatitis c coordinator in nearly all 50 state however state only get enough funding to cover the cost of the coordinator salary leave most coordinator with little or no budget for program and service such as testing and education I am the program shindo say we have no federal or state funding for hepatitis c screening or education we can not even afford billboard to put up the information regard who should be screen comment anybody,neutral,0

I have miss my mammogram for nearly three year because I actually was nurse my mom to her death with lung cancer and well I put my health on hold and since there is no one in my family with breast cancer I just think it can be on the back burner so while back in ca two week ago I see the doc and get all my test do and low and behold my mammo come back with a 13 mm oval mass on the right breast below the nipple and a 8 mm round mass in the same breast the write report mention the word calcium but then when they compare my other film from year ago they say this is new so off to have a tomosynthesis here in arizona but they are being slow to send my film and well I am nervous on one hand I am think maybe they say calcium to we before bring down the gauntlet so I am wonder if anyone have have any experience or know of anyone with a similar reading on their mammo but of course we are go deep as soon as the film arrive and will know one way or another what the heck it is so I appreciate anything and everything anyone here can add to help I understand this process with love and respect hayne,neutral,0
I have read a lot of discussion about smoking being a factor for develop lung cancer and also not being one and their thought towards it I agree that smoking for the most part is not the wise of idea if your wanting to lead a healthy life I do not agree with the fact that it cause it since I know too many people that have smoke many year and never develop lung cancer I believe that it is cause from a breakdown in the immune system where essential vitamin are lose or need and of course gene that are pass down to we it seem by now that they could detect these gene and also give something to people especially over the age of 50 to strengthen the immune system and make good cell strong to fight the bad cell that spread cancer my mom do develop lung cancer and do smoke so she do fall under that stereotype of lung cancer but there are very many that never have without cigarette my mom would of been miserable in her later day because that is all she have since she was a widow by 7 year when she past away and they comfort she and relax she and she enjoy it very much by the way she have degenerative bone disease since her early twenty and have always suffer with bone pain for many year she also become diabetic in her 50 so I have to think that just possibly the cancer come from some of those factor since I see a lot of people have diabete and then cancer I have read an article about cancer and it state that cancer cell love sugar so you should really watch your sugar intake I am glad my mom have her cigarette because they were like a good friend to she and she would of been miserable without in her final month so I do not blame she for that at all or the cigarette as I mention too many people who do not smoke or drink develop cancer as my mother in law even do and die at the age of 53 like her father who do not smoke and it was determined that it was an aggressive genetic cancer now we have to worry about my husband and our child whom it would not matter what they do because his mom eat very healthy and do not have bad habit I guess my message is that you should do what make you happy and try to limit some of the bad of course but just be comfortable in what you are do because life can be too short to do without and my mom die do what she love and I would not have it any other way and good for she we love you mom I think you should just do what ever make you feel good because in the end it would not matter because what go to happen will happen and that is that it is aggravating but I really am start to believe 100 in that I also do not like the way people who develop lung cancer are treat by some and especially doctor do not blame yourself for this disease just because it is call lung cancer my heart go out to all of you suffer with this disease good luck and good wish for success,positive,1

this is generally a pretty quiet board but I will give reach out a shot again my mom was originally diagnose about 11 month ago with stage 3 colon cancer and do 6 month of chemo when it stop it only take one month to not only return but to progress to stage 4 with 3 node of her liver affect so surgery is not an option she is back on chemo now it is really hard to not know how much long I have with she I may be 33 year old but I am not finish with my master until the end of next year and generally get a late start on this being an adult thing due to a very long battle with mental health issue I get really upset when I think about thing like if she will be there when I graduate when I get my first real job when I get marry I am with the man I will marry but not for a few more year want to finish my degree first when I have kid some of these none of these what amazing horrible moment where I want to call my mom will I not be able to when am I go to start have those horrible crying fit because this great horrible thing happen and I grab my phone to call my mom and remember I can not call my mom this is what bring tear to my eye I do not really have a mom specific prognosis I know the chance of her live another 5 year are slim to none I also know my grandmother live for 15 year after her diagnosis with a different kind of cancer and was a complete enigma to her oncologist since her cancer have a 50 5 year survival rate my mom have tell I that they are go to try for 12 more round of chemo every other week but she is not tolerate the drug very well so it will probably be more like 10 same conversation she tell I that she is likely be on chemo for the rest of her life this terrify I because when I put those two thing together it was like she tell I that she will be dead by the end of the year I hate the unknown of all of this and I am truly struggle because I am really bad at vulnerability I process thing to death before I will talk about they once I am truly capable of talk about something without feeling I will talk so I am really go through this largely alone because open up to those I know is really really hard even open up to my boyfriend anyone with thought or advice on any of this the unknown piece and how to handle it how to open up when the idea of open up about how I feel is really scary I go emotionally all over the place but mostly to vulnerable sad scared and yeah angry at the unfairness of it all thank for read,negative,-1

leukemia name of inventor history on august 2 1939 just before the beginning of world war ii albert einstein write to then president franklin d roosevelt einstein and several other scientist tell roosevelt of effort in nazi germany to purify uranium 235 which could be use to build an atomic bomb it was shortly thereafter that the united states government begin the serious undertaking know then only as the manhattan project simply put the manhattan project was commit to expedite research that would produce a viable atomic bomb make enriched uranium the most complicated issue to be address in making of an atomic bomb was the production of ample amount of enriched uranium to sustain a chain reaction at the time uranium 235 was very hard to extract in fact the ratio of conversion from uranium ore to uranium metal is 500 1 compounding this the one part of uranium that is finally refine from the ore is over 99 uranium 238 which is practically useless for an atomic bomb to make the task even more difficult the useful you 235 and nearly useless you 238 are isotope nearly identical in their chemical makeup no ordinary chemical extraction method could separate they only mechanical method could work a massive enrichment laboratory plant was construct at oak ridge tennessee harold urey and his colleague at columbia university devise an extraction system that work on the principle of gaseous diffusion and ernest lawrence inventor of the cyclotron at the university of california in berkeley implement a process involve magnetic separation of the two isotope next a gas centrifuge was use to far separate the light you 235 from the heavy non fissionable you 238 once all of these procedure have been complete all that need to be do was to put to the test the entire concept behind atomic fission split the atom in laymans term robert oppenheimer manhattan project over the course of six year from 1939 to 1945 more than 2 billion was spend during the history of the manhattan project the formula for refining uranium and put together a work atomic bomb were create and see to their logical end by some of the great mind of our time chief among the people who unleash the power of the atom was robert oppenheimer who oversee the project from conception to completion test the gadget aka atomic bomb finally the day come when all at los alamos would find out if the gadget code name as such during its development was go to be the colossal dud of the century or perhaps an end to the war it all come down to a fateful morning in midsummer 1945 at 5 29 45 mountain war time on july 16 1945 in a white blaze that stretch from the basin of the jemez mountain in northern new mexico to the still dark sky the gadget usher in the atomic age the light of the explosion then turn

I am a 21 year old university student and tomorrow is my mom 9th memorial day I was 12 when she die of lung and brain cancer and even though it is been 9 year today I am feel a flood of emotion that I think I have feel behind my mom and I were very close she was my teacher caretaker and good friend I am an only child and my mom have a very turbulent relationship with my dad and on top this all of our relative are in japan so my mom and I rely on each other for everything she was my rock until I was 10 when she become ill will colon cancer at the time I know how severe cancer was but I do not show how sad or scared I was because I do not want my parent and especially my mom to worry that summer I was send away to my grandmother in japan while my mom go through a gruele three month of surgery and chemo luckily the treatment have work and everything was back to normal for the next two year but one day in december of 2004 while visit a family friend in san fransisco my mom become very ill I know something was wrong but being the tough woman that she was she never say anything until come back home the doctor have discover that the cancer have spread to her lung brain and other lymph node it was too late when they discover this and they give she six month to live as a 12 year old I know exactly what was happen but I never shed a tear in front of she the cancer was aggressive and there was not much we could do for she but she want to stay home as much as possible so for about a month or so she have at home care the horrible thing I see and hear are still sear into my memory on day like today I can still hear she scream and cry my name while she slowly lose control of her own body it was so heartbreaking to see she refuse to eat because of the sore in her mouth and struggle to communicate because the cancer was destroy her brain cell each day she was become more and more of a stranger my dad was supportive but he was so helpless and that make I so furious three month after the diagnosis she die in the palliative care unit the last thing she whisper to I at her death bed was that now it was my turn to be the mom and look after the house so I take this to heart and I have been fulfil her wish ever since I was never give the permission to cry or grieve or even speak her name since her death it was just my dad and I leave with no other family member to support we he was always distant from my mom and I so the though of live with basically a stranger was terrify our way of cope was to not speak of this at all and this have continue ever since I never talk to any of my friend about this because I do not want to upset they I feel so alone and depressed but now that I was the mom I become so good at hide the shame guilt and loss if I was not do housework I fill any open time with extra curricular activity so that I do not have to think about it this lead to a self destructive burnout land I in therapy now after a year of therapy I am finally allow myself to grieve and think of she this is the very first memorial day where I am allow myself to be sad and to cry I feel so embarrassed that I am a 21 year old crying for mommy but I think this is something that I prevent myself from do all these year it is finally catch up to I it hard to think of happy time with she because the image of her sickness is still so overwhelming I wish that I have sibling or other family who ve experience this with I since my dad is still unapproachable I am feel so anxious about tomorrow because I want do to something to commemorate she but all I have do in the past year is to ignore the day completely do you have any suggestion of what to do how do you spend your mom memorial day,very negative,-2

I do not have have liver cancer or am sure if what my girlfriend have is liver cancer just try to understand what she is go through from what I know she go in for a a colonoscopy a year ago and have an adverse reaction to propofol after the procedure she come down with a fever of 106 and was send back to the hospital where she slip into a coma she was in complete kidney and liver failure after 5 day she come out the coma but the damage to her liver was do she was place on a liver transplant list but recover and lead a relatively normal and healthy life a month ago she wake up from a nap with jaundice and was tell by her doctor to go to the er to get some test do she was admit and spend 3 week of testing poking and prod it was extremely hard for I to watch but I stay by her side and sleep at the hospital while she was there for those three week she was fast track to the top of the list but the particular hospital she was in could not do a transplant in california I am still try to understand the protocol for assign the number give to patient on the list but she was 3 point short of qualify to be place on the list for a transplant in california the social worker explain that she qualify in alabama and in florida once we sign off on it we would place once the call come we would both be fly via charter to either alabama or florida she recover turn out that she have a e coli infection her transplant list assignment number come down and she was eventually release during this ordeal our relationship was test after she was settle back in to her regular life she become depressed and angry whether it the was drug depression or a combination of those two she become mean and distant towards I a simple disagreement lead to we decide it was good for I to leave she on her own mean thing were say towards I and my reason for stay with she it become too much feeling were hurt and I leave it is been two week without a word not want to give up she I reach out and find that she have sell her house all of her belonging give up custody of her 2 kid to her ex husband her jaundice have come back and her bili count is back up she stand 59 and weigh 125 pound but her stomach is distend and look like she is 5 month pregnant from the picture she send I do not know what if anything I can do I want to support she but she see the toll it was take on I and my own personal health and relation with my family and work she admit that she is scared and love I too much to see I hurt also so lost and confuse,negative,-1
lung cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cell growth in tissue of the lung this growth may lead to metastasis which is the invasion of adjacent tissue and infiltration beyond the lung the vast majority of primary lung cancer are carcinomas of the lung derive from epithelial cell lung cancer the most common cause of cancer relate death in man and the second most common in woman after breast cancer 1 is responsible for 1 3 million death worldwide annually 2 the most common symptom are shortness of breath cough include cough up blood and weight loss 3 the main type of lung cancer are small cell ography ct scan the diagnosis is confirm with a biopsy this is usually perform via bronchoscopy or ct guide biopsy treatment and prognosis depend upon the histological type of cancer the stage degree of spread and the patient performance status possible treatment include surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy with treatment the five year survival rate is 14 3 rene glenn 08 03 2008 in beloved memory,neutral,0

ok since the new research say that the retrovirus is link to prostate cancer and cfs then I was wonder do any of you have family member or a family history of prostate cancer here is the late research I am refer to retrovirus link to chronic fatigue syndrome xmrv see in 2 3 of cfs patient 10 million in you s may carry virus by daniel j denoon webmd health news review by louise chang md oct 8 2009 some 10 million americans may carry a recently discover retrovirus now link to chronic fatigue syndrome the virus xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus or xmrv was detect in 67 of 101 patient with chronic fatigue syndrome by vincent c lombardi phd of the whittemore peterson institute in reno nev and colleague the researcher also find the virus in nearly 4 of healthy comparison subject suggest that million of americans may carry the mysterious virus which was first detect in prostate cancer the discovery of xmrv in two major disease prostate cancer and now chronic fatigue syndrome is very exciting if cause and effect is establish there would be a new opportunity for prevention and treatment of these disease say robert h silverman phd of cleveland clinics lerner research institute in a statement email to webmd silverman is on of the team of scientist that first discover xmrv and was among the researcher link the virus to chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer it is not yet prove that xmrv actually cause either chronic fatigue or prostate cancer in prostate cancer patient the virus is see in patient who carry a genetic mutation that disable a key virus fight immune response but the virus is see in chronic fatigue patient with and without this mutation where do the virus come from the virus is closely relate to a retrovirus that is become part of the mouse genome oddly xmrv can not infect mouse cell but can easily infect human cell it is unlikely that so many human have catch xmrv from mice it is more likely that the virus is spread from human to human but how that happen remain to be see an editorial by john m coffin of tufts university boston and jonathan p stoye of the institute for medical research london accompany the lombardi report in the current issue of the online journal sciencexpress coffin and stoye note that if 4 of healthy people truly do carry xmrv it mean that the virus is astonishingly widespread if these figure are bear out in large study it would mean that perhaps 10 million people in the united states and hundred of million worldwide are infect with a virus whose pathogenic potential for human is still unknown they write what is know is that virus closely relate to xmrv do cause many different disease include cancer in other warm blooded animal further study may reveal xmrv as a cause of more than one well know old disease with potentially important implication for diagnosis prevention and therapy coffin and stoye suggest,neutral,0

october 13 2009 is a virus the cause of fatigue syndrome by denise grady could a virus be the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome a study publish last week in the journal science suggest that might be the case report that many patient who have the syndrome were infect with a recently discover virus chronic fatigue syndrome have long been a medical mystery and the subject of debate sometimes bitter among doctor researcher and patient it affect at least one million americans cause extreme fatigue muscle and joint pain sleep problem difficulty concentrate and other symptom its cause is unknown symptom can last for year and there is no effective treatment researcher disagree about whether it is one disease or a collection of symptom that may have different cause in different patient it have sometimes been stigmatize as more mental than physical with patient label neurotic depressed or hypochondriacal many patient find even the name of the disorder offensive a not so subtle hint that it is not a real disease the new report have intrigue scientist been see as vindication by some patient and inspire hope for a treatment I just feel like the whole future have change for we say anne ursu 36 a writer live in cleveland who have have the syndrome in the past but the new study is not conclusive and a great deal of work remain to be do to find out whether the new virus really do play a role just detect it in patient do not prove it is what make they sick people with the syndrome may have some other underlying problem that make they susceptible to the virus which could be just a passenger in their cell even so thousand of patient have already contact scientist ask to be test say dr judy mikovits the first author of the study and the research director at the whittemore peterson institute in reno a research center create by the parent of a woman who have the syndrome dr mikovits say she expect a test to become available within week the new suspect is a xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus or xmrv which probably descend from a group of virus that cause cancer in mouse how or when xmrv find its way into human is unknown but it have also been link to cancer in people it was first identify three year ago in prostate cancer and later detect in about one quarter of biopsy from man with that disease and in only 6 percent of benign biopsy it is a retrovirus from the same notorious family that cause aid and leukemia in people dr mikovit and researcher from the national cancer institute and the cleveland clinic report in science that 68 of 101 patient with chronic fatigue syndrome or 67 percent were infect with xmrv compare with only 3 7 percent of 218 healthy control subject further testing after the paper was write find the virus in nearly 98 percent of about 300 patient with the syndrome dr mikovits say she say she believe that the virus would eventually be find in every patient with chronic fatigue syndrome xmrv affect the immune system can probably cause a variety of illness and may join force with other virus to bring on the syndrome she say the study receive a mixed review from dr william c reeve who direct public health research on the syndrome at the center for disease control and prevention he call the research exciting but preliminary and say he was surprised that a prestigious journal like science have publish it because the researcher do not state the age or sex of the patient and control or describe the duration of the illness or how it come on if I do not know the nature of the case and control I can not interpret the finding dr reeve say we and other are look at our own specimen and try to confirm it he say add if we validate it great my expectation is that we will not he note that there have been false start before include a study in the 1990 link the syndrome to another retrovirus which could not be confirm by later research many patient and a community of doctor and researcher who specialize in the syndrome take issue with the disease center approach to the illness and the way it define who is affect they claim that the c d c include people whose problem are purely psychiatric muddy the water and confound effort to find a physical cause frustration with the lack of answer lead annette and harvey whittemore whose 31 year old daughter have have the syndrome for 20 year to spend several million dollar to set up a research institute at the university of nevada in reno in 2004 and to hire dr mikovit to direct it mrs whittemore say she have long believe that the syndrome was an infectious disease but that scientist have reject the idea she finally decide she say if there was a place of our own where we could find the answer we could do it more quickly dr william schaffner an infectious disease expert at vanderbilt university say that the notion of a linger viral infection was plausible he say that although some patient claim to have the syndrome seem more likely to have a psychological problem other seem to have a physical illness there is a group who are young healthy active and engage and all of a sudden they are lay low by something dr schaffner say everyone tell the physician these are people who are functional and productive and this is totally out of character they are frustrated and often quite dishearten you feel that medical science have not catch up with their illness yet to determine whether xmrv is to blame more study are need say dr john coffin a professor of molecular biology and microbiology at tufts university it would help to find an animal model he say and to look at store blood sample to find out if there were people who become ill some set amount of time after contract the virus if antiviral drug make patient improve that will also help make the case against the virus he say the national cancer institute is take xmrv seriously say dr stuart le grice head of its center of excellence in hiv aids and cancer virology he say health official become especially concerned last spring when several research team look at prostate cancer report find xmrv in 3 percent to 4 percent of blood sample from healthy people in control group that could translate into 10 million american being infect with a newly discover poorly understand retrovirus that have already been link to two disease any virus at that level is obviously cause for concern dr le grice say add that it was important to find out if the virus was associate with any more disease and how closely he say that just carry the virus do not necessarily mean a person was at high risk for disease note that people may harbor other virus that will never harm they the immune system probably keep the virus in check but he ask if it is a problem how well can we diagnose it and how well can we treat it even though antiretroviral drug have already been develop to treat h i v infection he say this virus was different and might need its own line of drug he say more study were need to find out how common the virus is and how it is being transmit it is not know whether people can catch the disease from mouse or can infect one another retrovirus are often spread by blood and bodily fluid how significant a risk is this to blood bank dr le grice ask do we need to consider large scale screening in blood bank he say the institute would be work to develop reliable diagnostic test dr le grice emphasize that there is no evidence that the virus is spread through the population I do not want to scare anyone at the moment he say,neutral,0

php xmrv test xmrv information disclaimer xmrv and disease xmrv xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus was first isolate in prostate cancer tissue of man with a specific defect of the anti viral gene rnase l in 2009 a science paper from lombardi et al report detection of xmrv in 67 of patient with chronic fatigue syndrome recently another study by lo et al publish in the pna report that 86 5 of cfs patient 32 of 37 sample test present murine leukemia virus mlv relate sequence in their pbmc dna however more research is need to confirm the implication and exact role of xmrv and or mlvs in cfs and other disease a number of study have fail to detect xmrv in sample from cfs patient it is not clear whether this is due to technical issue or to regional variation in virus prevalence also association do not mean causality reactivation of xmrv mlv may be the result of pre exist immune dysfunction in cfs patient rather than a real cause for the disease some study suggest that the virus could be present in 4 to 14 of the general population it appear that several variant of these virus can be detect in test subject so far little is know regard the geographical distribution of these variant and their exact role in the pathogenesis of cfs they may not all have the same capacity to trigger the disease or contribute to its symptom red laboratory is currently conduct a number of research study on xmrv mlv but we have not yet accumulate enough datum to support any claim regard xmrv prevalence and association with disease test currently offer at red laboratory co culture red laboratory have license the proprietary xmrv test from wp biotechnologie a wholly own subsidiary of the whittemore peterson institute we use the co culture procedure where the sample to be test is put in contact with an infection sensitive cell line xmrv is allow to replicate in the cell for several day result in significant amplification of viral titer the amplified virus can then more easily be detect by pcr or western blot to perform this test we ask 3x 8 ml whole blood in na heparin tube 1x 2ml yellow cap tube and 2x 2ml whole blood in edta tube specimen must be receive within 48 hour at room temperature cost of this test is 340 this price include the co culture and a screen for other mlv relate virus by direct pcr on whole blood serology red laboratory have make an agreement with vipdx reno nevada to offer serology testing sample will be collect in our laboratory and send to vipdx for analysis to perform this test we ask 1x serum separator tube yellow cap cost of this test is 219 this price include first processing of sample serum separation store shipping to the usa and reporting of result detection of mlv related virus by pcr and sequence this test is base on the publication by lo et al who report the detection of mlv relate sequence in the blood of cfs patient to perform this test we ask 1x 2ml whole blood in edta tube purple cap cost of this test is 108 note that it is include in the co culture test so you do not have to order mlv screen if you already request co culture we have the capacity to sequence the pcr product however this is currently perform only for internal use quality control research project we may start routine sequence in the future if it appear that distinguish the different virus variant is clinically important interpretation of result advantage and limitation of each of these test must be fully understand before draw any conclusion in any case interpretation must be do by a physician co culture is very sensitive and most importantly is the only test that can distinguish active infection from latent one one limitation is the fact that it is perform from blood cell it may therefore not be able to detect a virus which is present in another part of the body gut spleen also the co culture procedure have been develop and validate for xmrv it use a specific target cell sensitive to xmrv infection although it is likely that most virus variant are able to infect this target cell line this have not yet been demonstrate therefore there is a possibility that certain virus like mlvs can not be detect by this technique serology will be able to detect antibody even when the virus is localize in another tissue than blood it is probably able to detect most variant of xmrv and mlv related virus a major limitation of serology however is that it do not give any indication regard the stage of infection it may also give false negative result in the case of patient with a deficient immune system which are unable to make adequate antibody in the future the lack of specificity may also be an issue if it turn out that variant identification is important for clinical evaluation mlv pcr on whole blood can give very precious information when follow by sequence since it allow very precise variant identification a quantitative pcr test is in development in order to measure viral titer and not only presence of the virus pcr can be perform on any type of tissue include biopsy saliva csf a combination of different approach is probably the good way to test for xmrv and or mlv relate virus a well understanding of xmrv mlv biology is necessary before we can evaluate with certainty the sensitivity specificity and clinical relevance of the different approach use to detect these virus get a negative result do not definitely mean that you are not infect you may be infect with a specific variant not detect by any of these approach or the viral titer may be too low at the time of testing red laboratory do not make any claim regard the biological significance and medical implication of a positive result only physician can do test interpretation define treatment option and answer question regard transmissibility and health implication cheer al,neutral,0

it is complicate by jodi scott 2 hour ago it always is when it come to elinor health but as her oncologist say today you re not average but no one is so let we start from top to bottom cover the ct scan as we do with the doctor the lung were clear the clot are still there but small but they do not see the nodule that was previously there the liver tumor are all small some much small the previously 5 cm pancreatic mass is now 2 9 cm she do have some ascite which is an accumulation of fluid in the abdoman make by the cancer cell this is contribute to she bloat and fullness the red herring is the ovary both ovary have increase in size the left is just cystic and likely benign the right ovary is now 11 6 cm and complex appear so what do this mean that is the million dollar question it could represent a mixed response to chemotherapy some of the pancreatic cancer is respond and some is not or this could mean a second process possibly something call a borderline ovarian tumor which mean it can behave like a malignant tumor but is usually much slow grow or much less likely a second ovarian primary cancer the only definitive way to answer this question is with surgery the issue with that blood thinner and chemotherapy we would have to stop the lovenox which would risk a recurrence of a pulmonary embolus blood clot in the lung and we would have to stop chemotherapy for at least 3 week which would not be the end of the world but I would really prefer not to do that since were see a response so in the end we all agree to proceed with a paracentesis as the next step so we will go into radiology tomorrow morning and they will drain off the ascite in the abdomen through a very small needle this provide 2 benefit first it will hopefully help improve the bloating and fullness second they will send the fluid to lab to see if there is any way to determine what type of cell are in the ascite probably not high yield but worth send elinor also have an mri to re evaluate the lesion on her sacrum that was discover on an mri do on 12 26 13 this have grow slightly but do not change the plan in any way follow the doctor appointment we proceed with chemotherapy as plan elinor will have tumor marker draw every 2 week and scan repeat in 8 week they will follow a ca 125 which is a tumor marker that can be associate with ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumor other thing can make this elevate so it is not highly specific but the general trend may give we some answer she ca 19 9 which is the tumor marker we are follow for the pancreatic cancer have drop over time and was down to 28 000 on february 26th she have one draw today but we would not get those result back until thursday or friday now well move on to the mg neurology talk for all of you out there whom elinor so gratefully rely upon for support after do some investigate I personally in my ob gyn opinion wink wink think it is more likely that elinor have lem lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome which is highly associate with a malignancy and her symptom just seem to fit this pattern well than mg we ask elinor oncologist if he could order a voltage gate calcium channel antibody which can help diagnose this and he was more than happy to add this on to her other lab work it would be silly not to this is not always positive in lem but if it is then that is a slam dunk we can ask the neurologist for 3 4 diaminopyridine 3 4 dap which should improve her symptom for muscle weakness well than the mestinon alone now well move on to the running talk for all of her run family cheerleader and fan she have hear back from the race director of the boston mararthon and the board say yes to let she run walk just the last mile now security and the boston police department have to ok it finger and toe cross today the woman sit next to my sister in the infusion center overhear we talk and turn and say that was you in that interview when I see that I was cheer you on she wish my sister luck and tell she she was out there run for a lot of people with cancer that she have a huge group behind her elinor reply I will run for everyone who sit in one of these chair I will provide a link to the interview that she and martha do with wcco neither one of they have watch it but the rest of we are very proud of their grace feel free to share it like it on facebook tweet it anything to get the word out there http minnesota cbslocal com 2014 03 10 woman aim to finish boston marathon despite pancreatic can wowza that was a long update I do not think I have anything else to add except my final thought we can not possibly say it enough we appreciate you each and every one of you we appreciate the warm thought the kind word act of kindness the prayer the support the love everything it mean more than anyone could possibly imagine we use it to lift ourselves up in the darkest moment and make our bright moment even brighter thank you,neutral,0

chronic fatigue syndrome a recent study link the disorder to a virus was a victory for the little guy for one thing the study point to a physical cause for an illness that the medical establishment have often snidely dismiss as psychosomatic the research could not be ignore it was publish last month in science one of the world pickiest and most prestigious journal the discovery come in a sense from within the patient own rank several of the scientist include the lead author of the report work for the whittemore peterson institute for neuro immune disease a nonprofit in reno nev found recently by the parent of a young woman who have the syndrome and even though the institute was new it have attract collaborator from two high powered center the national cancer institute and the cleveland clinic harvey and annette whittemore were not the first to start a research foundation out of desperation to find answer for an incurable disease the actor michael j fox do the same for his own illness parkinson disease other have create group for pancreatic cancer amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lou gehrig disease and breast cancer the foundation have in common a desire to pick up the pace of research often by finance innovative idea and avoid red tape and bureaucracy but few if any of the private group have produce notable result as quickly as the whittemore peterson institute have at least one million americans have chronic fatigue syndrome which cause severe fatigue muscle and joint pain sleep problem difficulty concentrate and other problem its cause is unknown symptom can last for year and there is no effective treatment woman outnumber man as patient and many people with the syndrome feel stigmatize and brush off as neurotic by doctor andrea whittemore goad who is 31 have have a severe case of the syndrome for 20 year three major medical institution try to marginalize she tell she she do not want to get well annette whittemore say in an interview but mrs whittemore have see her daughter turn abruptly from a happy healthy child to a very sick one and she have steadfastly believe that some sort of infection must have been the cause researcher have not pursue the infection theory seriously enough in her opinion and doctor have been scornful one physician tell she that if he could not understand her daughter lab result they could not be important another say he do not look at my daughter medical information because he do not want the fact to get in the way of his theory mrs whittemore say in an e mail message I could write a book on ridiculous thing that doctor say to patient with c f s she add one day I just have enough I say I have get to do something she and her husband have the mean the knowledge and the connection they are real estate developer and part owner of a gas company and an energy drink and they hold interest in other business mister whittemore is also a lawyer and a lobbyist start in the fall of 2004 they put 5 million of their own money into set up an institute at the university of nevadas medical school they also persuade the governor and state legislature to commit 10 million for a new building that would house the institutes researcher and a clinic as well as scientist from the university and the nevada cancer institute the research begin in 2006 and a clinic for patient is schedule to open in about a year rather than just dole out money to far fling researcher the whittemore want to employ their own scientist who would be devote full time to the cause in the spring of 2006 they meet dr judy a mikovits a virus expert who have spend 22 year work at the national cancer institute she have leave the institute in 2001 to get married and move to california where she go to work for a drug development company that fail she was tend bar at a yacht club when a patron say her constant talk about virus remind he of someone he know in nevada that person was a friend of annette whittemore dr mikovits soon find herself at a conference on chronic fatigue syndrome the meeting was terrible she say the science in c f s is awful not because the researcher are awful but because they have no resource but one presentation make she practically leap out of her seat the speaker was dr daniel l peterson who treat miss whittemore goad he is the peterson for whom the institute is name he have see about 5 000 patient with the syndrome in the last 20 year and he describe some who have also develop a rare type of lymphoma I say that is a retrovirus dr mikovits recall dr mikovits begin connect the dot almost immediately she know that some patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and some man with prostate cancer have a certain enzyme deficiency and she also know that tissue sample from man with prostate cancer have been find to harbor a retrovirus call xmrv for xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus she begin work part time with the institute and by the fall of 2006 the whittemore have hire she as research director one of her first project was to look for xmrv in blood sample from people with chronic fatigue syndrome and from healthy control subject many of the sample from syndrome patient 68 of 101 or 67 percent were infect she and her colleague report in science only 3 7 percent of the healthy control carry the virus xmrv the scientist suggest may cause or at least contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome further test find the virus in 90 of the 101 dr mikovits say retrovirus can cause cancer in animal and in human they include hiv and a virus that can cause leukemia I know how serious a retrovirus is mrs whittemore say I was very concerned know there would be serious implication my second thought was of course it was go to be something serious like that look at my daughter and how ill she is why would we expect it to be something simple I also feel like the weight of world was on my shoulder we would have to be tell people some very bad news but many patient were grateful and say they find hope in the discovery hope that now their illness would be take seriously and hope that the new information would lead to effective treatment or even a cure but the study is not conclusive other scientist need to replicate the test to find out if the initial finding hold up and a great deal more work is need to determine whether xmrv really do play a role just detect it in patient do not prove it make they sick patient may have some other underlying problem that make they susceptible to xmrv which could be just a passenger in their cell dr peterson say he think the crux of the problem in chronic fatigue syndrome involve a derangement in the immune system that could allow old viral infection with various herpe virus for instance that were once under control to become active again xmrv is the sort of agent that could create that effect on the immune system dr peterson say but he emphasize that more research was need among those expect to try to replicate the xmrv finding is the center for disease control and prevention but dr william c reeve who direct the agencys research on the syndrome have say that he do not expect to find the virus in blood sample from patient he say that no other study have ever prove a virus to be the cause and that stress and a history of sexual and emotional abuse were more likely to play a role in many case I blame the c d c for most of this mess mrs whittemore say add that thinking like dr reevess was what drive she to start her own research center the whittemore peterson institute is run on about 1 million a year to pay for salary equipment supply and other expense in the world of research that is not much the whittemore are try to raise more money and have receive donation as large as 50 000 from friend down to a few dollar from patient who are sick out of work and break but eager to support any research that may one day help they mrs whittemore feel that she is race against time to save her daughter for a while miss whittemore goad have improve on an antiviral drug but she have to stop take it because she have a reaction to it she have work part time as a yoga instructor and she marry in the last year but now rarely go out because she have seizure she is just really very very sick mrs whittemore say she is have this for a long time we ve get to get something for she as soon

below is the journey of a little 4 year old girl name abigail I have never meet abigail personally but I know her dad and her good friend emily emily live on my street and emilys dad do some painting in our home a little over a year ago they were a struggle christian family at that time as it was hard for he to find contracting work in the small community we live in not too long after that I have learn from his friend in the neighborhood that they have move north and that he was now a border patrol inspector this past january there was a prayer request at church for a family who have a little girl name abigail that have been emergency medevace out by helicopter to have a blood transfusion several hundred mile away and that they have just learn that she have leukemia I ask the person if it was the same family it was since they begin their 2 3 year medical treatment they have a join the caringbridge org website and have start a log about their journey so that friend family and prayer partner can keep abr of their experience I have select a few excerpt from the entry because even though it do not pertain to estrangement it do certainly speak volume of how other christian do have their heartbreaking trial that are just as painful and just as challenging as their situation is recently I was read how some here have reach the point of give up because the struggle just seem to be too hard to keep go on I know from personal experience just what they are go through because I was there too for I in order for I not to fall back into that pit of despair I depend on god bring I people like the following to help I to feel so much love and gratitude to and for our lord precious wisdom just recently there was a topic about unanswered prayer this familys amazing story of strength and courage in the face of adversity is just what god lead I to in order to tell I that he have been there all along in my own situation and that good do come from adversity it also speak of how sometimes seemingly unanswered prayer is really answer prayer after all and sometime not the way that we think is good for we _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ january 19 2013 I was over come with emotion the other day when it dawn on I just what an all know all powerful god we have I still deeply mourn the loss of our son michael his due date would have been feb 9 2013 all along I have been think that the timing would be perfect and then for god to take he home to heaven you question why I am not angry or bitter but sometimes you just need answer sometimes god give they and sometimes not he give I the answer to my question why he know that this situation with abigail was go to take place he know that she would need I for I to have have a new bear baby just a few week after find out abigail have leukemia and have to go through all that she have to he know tear january 26 2013 yesterday abigail was discharge from the hospital after the three hour drive we get back to our house close to 10 pm the kid were exhaust after a long day esp for abigail who have have procedure do that day as well as a chemo treatment well when we get there we quickly realize that the furnace have stop work the house was fill with smoke and the pipe freeze so those that know I well know that yes I just laugh it was either that or cry I mean seriously our precious daughter was just diagnose with leukemia have been through so much this past week and now this we make several phone call include one to our pastor I ask if he know of a place we could just crash for the night he graciously put we up in a local hotel for the night michaels port director come by offer her support and help the kid and I get settle in the hotel while michael stay at the house work with the specialist before we even go to bed last night a family from the church which have a home they were not use offer it to we to stay until we get thing straighten out is god faithful or what the song I am a friend of god come to my head this morning I am so glad I can call he my friend god is so good february 5 2013 a handful of hair I have always enjoy brushing and do abigail hair but recently it is been bittersweet with each pass day more and more hair come out not just a few piece but by the time I am do brush her hair the entire brush is full of hair it is hard see she lose her hair it is hard to see she double over in pain due to constipation because of medication it is hard watch she walk up the stair and struggle to get to the top because in her word it is just so hard am I bitter no frustrated irritated question why yes sometimes but not bitter and this is why I have been there do that in the past bitterness is something that I have struggle with if I tell you the circumstance why I was bitter you d probably understand and might even agree with I it was not until a crisis point that I realize how bitter I really was and if I have not have a high power to help I I would not have been able to conquer it it was so deep that humanly it was impossible to gain victory over when I come to the realization of it my daily prayer to the lord the high power was god please take this bitterness away from I short simple and to the point it was not an overnight turn around it take a lot of effort on my part and a lot patience on god part but between the two of we we manage to get it under control during this process I come across this quote it say bitterness is like swallow poison and expect the other person to die from it hmmm I think that is pretty good I read it again bitterness is like swallow poison and expect the other person to die from it wow wow that is really good I think how true is that whether you re bitter at a situation a person or even god who is it hurt is it hurt the situation individual or god no it is only hurt you yourself and those around you probably the one you love most I am sure everyone have at least once experience being around a bitter person you walk away exhausted and maybe even a little depressed yourself so to answer the question that some have ask no I am not bitter and with god help I will not allow bitterness back into my life will I have bad day deal with this situation of course but life is too short to allow another minute of bitterness back in I can not even imagine what kind of mother I would be to abigail right now if I was still bitter she need the good right now and that is what I am go to give her http www caringbridge org visit abigailjohnston mystory _ _ _ _ _

expert and consumer alike and there are no easy answer but when prevention talk to the people at the forefront of food safety and ask they one simple questionwhat food do you avoid we get some pretty interesting answer although these food do not necessarily make up a ban list as you head into the holidaysand all the grocery shopping that come with ittheir answer are well food for thought 1 can tomatoes the expert fredrick vom saal phd an endocrinologist at the university of missouri who study bisphenol a the problem the resin lining of tin can contain bisphenol a a synthetic estrogen that have been link to ailment range from reproductive problem to heart disease diabete and obesity unfortunately acidity a prominent characteristic of tomato cause bpa to leach into your food study show that the bpa in most people body exceed the amount that suppress sperm production or cause chromosomal damage to the egg of animal you can get 50 mcg of bpa per liter out of a tomato can and that is a level that is go to impact people particularly the young say vom saal I would not go near canned tomato the solution choose tomato in glass bottle which do not need resin lining such as the brand bionaturae and coluccio you can also get several type in tetra pak box like trader joe and pomi 2 corn fed beef the expert joel salatin co owner of polyface farm and author of half a dozen book on sustainable farming the problem cattle evolve to eat grass not grain but farmer today feed their animal corn and soybean which fatten up the animal fast for slaughter more money for cattle farmer and low price at the grocery store mean a lot less nutrition for we a recent comprehensive study conduct by the usda and researcher from clemson university find that compare with corn fed beef grass fed beef is high in beta carotene vitamin e omega 3s conjugate linoleic acid cla calcium magnesium and potassium lower in inflammatory omega 6s and low in saturate fat that have been link to heart disease we need to respect the fact that cow are herbivore and that do not mean feed they corn and chicken manure say salatin the solution buy grass fed beef which can be find at specialty grocer farmer market and nationally at whole food it is usually label because it demand a premium but if you do not see it ask your butcher 3 microwave popcorn the expert olga naidenko phd a senior scientist for the environmental working group the problem chemical include perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the lining of the bag are part of a class of compound that may be link to infertility in human accord to a recent study from ucla in animal testing the chemical cause liver testicular and pancreatic cancer study show that microwave cause the chemical to vaporizeand migrate into your popcorn they stay in your body for year and accumulate there say naidenko which is why researcher worry that level in human could approach the amount cause cancer in laboratory animal dupont and other manufacturer have promise to phase out pfoa by 2015 under a voluntary epa plan but million of bag of popcorn will be sell between now and then the solution pop natural kernel the old fashioned way in a skillet for flavoring you can add real butter or dry seasoning such as dillwee vegetable flake or soup mix your nutritional guide to grocery shop 4 nonorganic potato the expert jeffrey moyer chair of the national organic standard board the problem root vegetable absorb herbicide pesticide and fungicide that wind up in soil in the case of potatoesthe nation most popular vegetabletheyre treat with fungicide during the grow season then spray with herbicide to kill off the fibrous vine before harvesting after they are dig up the potato are treat yet again to prevent they from sprout try this experiment buy a conventional potato in a store and try to get it to sprout it would not say moyer who is also farm director of the rodale institute also own by rodale inc the publisher of prevention I have talk with potato grower who say point blank they would never eat the potato they sell they have separate plot where they grow potato for themselves without all the chemical the solution buy organic potato washing is not good enough if you re try to remove chemical that have been absorb into the flesh 5 farm salmon the expert david carpenter md director of the institute for health and the environment at the university at albany and publisher of a major study in the journal science on contamination in fish the problem nature do not intend for salmon to be cram into pen and fed soy poultry litter and hydrolyzed chicken feather as a result farm salmon is low in vitamin d and high in contaminant include carcinogen pcb brominate flame retardant and pesticide such as dioxin and ddt accord to carpenter the most contaminated fish come from northern europe which can be find on american menus you can only safely eat one of these salmon dinner every 5 month without increase your risk of cancer say carpenter whose 2004 fish contamination study get broad medium attention it is that bad preliminary science have also link ddt to diabetes and obesity but some nutritionist believe the benefit of omega 3s outweigh the risk there is also concern about the high level of antibiotic and pesticide use to treat these fish when you eat farm salmon you get dose with the same drug and chemical the solution switch to wild catch alaska salmon if the package say fresh atlantic it is farm there are no commercial fishery leave for wild atlantic salmon delicious and easy fish recipe 6 milk produce with artificial hormone the expert rick north project director of the campaign for safe food at the oregon physician for social responsibility and former ceo of the oregon division of the american cancer society the problem milk producer treat their dairy cattle with recombinant bovine growth hormone rbgh or rbst as it is also know to boost milk production but rbgh also increase udder infection and even pus in the milk it also lead to high level of a hormone call insulin like growth factor in milk in people high level of igf 1 may contribute to breast prostate and colon cancer when the government approve rbgh it was think that igf 1 from milk would be break down in the human digestive tract say north as it turn out the casein in milk protect most of it accord to several independent study there is not 100 proof that this is increase cancer in human admit north however it is ban in most industrialize country the solution check label for rbgh free rbst free produce without artificial hormone or organic milk these phrase indicate rbgh free product 7 conventional apple the expert mark kastel former executive for agribusiness and codirector of the cornucopia institute a farm policy research group that support organic food the problem if fall fruit hold a most douse in pesticide contest apple would win why they are individually graft descend from a single tree so that each variety maintain its distinctive flavor as such apple do not develop resistance to pest and are spray frequently the industry maintain that these residue are not harmful but kastel counter that it is just common sense to minimize exposure by avoid the most doused produce like apple farm worker have high rate of many cancer he say and increase number of study are start to link a high body burden of pesticide from all source with parkinson disease the solution buy organic apple if you can not afford organic be sure to wash and peel they first,neutral,0

the follow is a copy of the email I send my church family today the il28b test that was take a month ago is tt the least responsive and I am a1 I promise not to do a long post like this again but I want to tell you all like I tell my church family hi to all this will probably be my last update for quite a while it have been a little over 19 month now since my liver transplant as most of you know the transplant got rid of the cancerous tumor and the beginning of cirrhosis cause by the hepatitis c that I have have for over 30 year probably cause by blood that was give to I during surgery at that time I still have the hep c since transplant do not get rid of it I think I would be start treatment for that very soon but today I get a call from my liver specialist say that they have decide not to do the treatment because of the genotype of hep c that I have along with some other blood test and symptom I am have from the med I am already on and also because of my loss of weight and muscle mass from the transplant that I am still deal with they feel the treatment would not work and would only make I bad the hep c is already cause problem for my new liver research is go on all the time to find new more successful treatment but so far there is nothing new for post transplant patient there is just the old interferon and ribarivin which need to be take for 11 month and are usually very hard on the system the transplant center will continue to do scan every 6 month or so to make sure the cancer have not come back and they do not expect it to the will continue to check my lung liver and bone for that so I will continue to work my 3 night a week and live my life one reason I have miss some sunday lately is because I work all night sit night as we know we are in god hand and he is the great physician I have already claim his healing and it will come sometimes our healing come soon sometimes in our lifetime and sometimes it come the second we go to be with the lord but it do come nobody will have disease in heaven I am pray for all of you and I ask for your continue prayer also I realize that there are many in our church who are in much bad circumstance than I am I love you all and thank for let I bend your ear one more time,negative,-1

I keep test on the low side for platelet wbc and rbc I am wonder about something I read I read that the body put iron in the liver when there is an infection to hide it from the infection it say that the bacteria need iron to multiply so the body is hide the iron in the liver as a protective measure if there is a viral infection do the body hide the iron in the liver too and since the hcv virus live and multiplie in the liver do it do that because it have find the iron and since the infection do not go away with hep c and it being slow progressing is it possible that when your blood is test the iron is hide in the liver and do not show up in a routine blood test my rbc go down when my viral load go up from 1 8 million to 5 million I have read or hear that the virus can take vacation in many place in the body that although it replicate in the liver cell that it also travel in the blood stream and can camp out and take a break from replication hep c cell have been find in bone and other place in the body they can be dormant there for year and then get back to the liver and start replicate again which is why the virus is so hard to totally eliminate it is reasonable then to surmise that since the virus is not a cell it do not follow cell protocol and do not need to do anything at all to survive what kill the tiny viral unit I read an article about how small they are 3 million small pox virus lay in a flat circle would cover an area the size of a period if one of those virus was the size of a brick the hep c virus would be the size of a blueberry next to it,neutral,0

hello team just want to give a quick update I was suppose to be get my first day of chemo today for bmt but the doctor at stanford throw we a curve ball last week my nih doctor have diagnose I with myeologenous hypereosinophilic syndrome chronic eosinophilic leukemia m he s cel this is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm mpn after my third bone marrow biopsy the doctor at stanford have a slightly different approach their diagnosis is systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological non mast cell disease that is likely chronic eosinophilic leukemia sm ahnmd cel in addition to the vast number of eosinophil in my bone marrow all of the biopsy have show aggregate of spindle shape mast cell my nih doc say that the differ diagnosis are semantic apparently eosinophil and mast cell hang in the same biological circle so in the absence of specific genetic clonality it is impossible to say whether my disease is primarily eosinophilic with secondary mastocytosis or primarily mastocytosis with secondary eosinophilia welcome to the wonderful world of have an uber rare disease more than six month in and still no diagnosis when I ask my doc for any sort of prognosis they all look at each other and shrug their shoulder with the exception of say that it will eventually kill I if we do not get it under control that could be one month or five year either way we are look at this new option as a blessing despite the uncertainty we are now establish a path to get this new drug midostaurin which is a tki that have have limited success in aml patient the doctor do not want to leave I off of any treatment as my absolute eosinophil count aec continue to slowly rise last cbc I have a wbc of 27 with aec at 20 5 they start I on hydroxyurea 1 gram day to see if that would lower the count as a bridge strategy to get to midostaurin midostaurin just finish phase ii trial and is not approve by the fda novartis is the drug company and they must say yes for compassionate use as well as the fda which may take 2 month or more then another two month to see if it work my doctor who was primary investigator on the trial is unsure if it will work but think it is worth the risk to wait to try of the 116 patient in the trial 5 present in a similar manner sm ahnmd with cel 4 of those 5 have a complete resolution of their eosinophilia additionally for those of you follow the beat aml initiative my doctor also send off my blood for evaluation with jeff tyner use the same technique for aml genome mapping with the hope that another tki might be well suit for I than even midostaurin http www ll org who we are a new approach to drug discovery src1 35591 src2 as I have become more and more versed on this subject I am more and more encouraged by the progress in beat myeologenous leukemia of all form I am fairly certain that in 20 year leukemia of this variety will be treat first with induction then tki to vastly reduce chance of relapse and then bmt only in rare occasion cml have mostly been beat replace by take a pill with few side effect we can do this too with aml I would encourage all of you out there to write your doc to send any blood that may still be store to jeff tyner and the lab if pathway exist I remember dave tell I at the beginning of this journey for I that we are all part of the process to beat this disease I take that to heart and wholeheartedly agree what I would ask of the team for I personally is to continue pray specifically for the wisdom to make the right choice between bmt and drug therapy for protection of my heart and other organ from all the eosinophil for hydroxyurea to work as a bridge strategy and for midostaurin to be approve for I and to work if you have any experience with hydroxyurea or midostaurin I would appreciate any info as well we are so thankful for you all and pray for everyone here daily hope and health for everyone vr john,positive,1

to contact the health agency in atlanta via e mail or phone to obtain that information now remove from the web site a spokeswoman say among its problem the document omit mention of the cancer cause chemical benzene which military sampling find in a base well in 1984 researcher should have mention its high level and try to verify whether it reach the drinking water say cibula he say ensminger recently bring the omission of benzene to his attention additionally the contaminate solvent that official focus on have been characterize by new science as even more likely to cause cancer he note cibula also cite finding report in a 2007 associated press investigation of the water contamination that the study underestimate the extent of the contamination on the base due to inadequate information from the marine his unusual announcement come at a meeting of the health agency part of the health and human service department and its community advisory panel that work on follow up to camp lejeune past water problem member of the panel have long criticize the health document failing lawmaker who hear the marine story last year dub they poison patriot a table in the document state

veteran affair and other as say no way no how would any person who drink contaminate water at camp lejeune be expect to suffer any adverse health effect be they cancerous or non cancerous the science is just not that good for we to make that determination he say the 1997 assessment say children cancer risk was unknown but it cite study show potential cancer danger from solvent taint water for fetus that lead to an ongoing study by the agency into whether baby whose mother drink the water were bear with elevated leukemia or birth defect the agency estimate as many as 1 million people at the atlantic seaboard base could have been expose to the toxin the marine have estimate 500 000 level of one solvent know as tce were the high ever measure in a you s public water supply accord to an agency scientist we keep come up with more and more stuff say allen menard a former marine on the community panel who suffer a rare non hodgkin lymphoma that his doctor link to chemical exposure they know about the benzene he say why do not they tell we the reversal come at a sensitive time for the toxic substance agency follow a blister report last month by congressional investigator who accuse it of obscure or overlook potential health hazard at toxic site the agencys director howard frumkin promise congress he was work to improve on any shortcoming military family have suffer needlessly

the essential anti oxidant for detox the liver glutathione supplementation is not the answer it is expensive and do not make it to the liver it gets destroy before it get there what we need to take are food and supplement that increase glutathione level in the body the good news is that your body produce its own glutathione the bad news is that poor diet pollution toxin medication stress trauma age hep c and other viral bacterial and fungal infection and radiation all deplete your glutathione glutathione is a very simple molecule that is produce naturally all the time in your body it is a combination of three simple building block of protein or amino acid cysteine glycine and glutamine glutathione is critical in help your immune system do its job of fight infection and prevent cancer it is also helpful in ease the pain of arthritis along with selenium and vitamin c eat food that support glutathione production this would include cruciferous vegetable broccoli cauliflower brussels sprouts cabbage radishe kohlrabi mustard green kale collard green turnip rutabagas watercress and horseradish also garlic and onion turmeric cinnamon and cardamom spinach tomatoe pea and rice bran avocado peach and watermelon are also report to raise glutathione level asparagus avocado raw great of all time milk and walnut are rich source of glutathione this one website say that real hellmana s mayonnaise also provide 660 mg of ala per 1 tablespoon I am think it is the raw egg which is also a supporter of glutathione production as well as fresh unprocessed meat sushi anyone steak tartare I would not touch meat unless it was organic grass fed beef organic chicken or wild catch salmon I add organic raw egg to my smoothie for awhile but there are gentle way to increase glutathione production in the body information about cruciferous veggie and their health benefit http www dailystrength org group alternative treatment for hep c news view 1738419 supplement would include nac ala either or both depend on your budget I choose ala I use to take both dr burkson who do the mushroom poisoning testing in new mexico find that when ala was use with milk thistle liver damage from hep c was reverse and liver enzyme level return to normal ala protect the liver regenerate liver tissue reduce risk of liver cancer reduce joint inflammation enhance mental memory and clarity stimulate the immune system and enhance energy level ala have show remarkable effect in help diabetic patient by normalize blood sugar level it increase glucose uptake by muscle cell lead to more energy and stimulate muscle recover and tone it also protect the nerve network of the body ease nerve pain and can restore damage nerve ala for chronic hep c take 300 mg twice daily I take 600 once daily cheap that way nac increase glutathione level help prevent cancer is also anti viral support the immune system protect the liver the dosage for nac is about 3 time the high dose of ala 500 600 mg 3x daily with food take with 1000 3000 mg c 50 mg zinc and 200 mcg selenium for good result also take your b vitamin c e selenium and silymarin milk thistle extract but no pun intend the good way to increase glutathione in the liver is with coffee enema it increase the level 6 7 time how to do a coffee enema get some really good therapeutic roast very light roast organic coffee bean I get mine from cafemam http cafemam com store choose the regular under caffiene choose therapy roast under roast if you do not have a really good grinder choose therapy grind under grind choose whole bean if you can grind it yourself cheap little 20 grinder are not go to last long grind these superb quality bean I use a family grain mill I also use it to grind brown rice for my dog meal it also grind oat into flour and there is another attachment that flake oats so much well fresh for sure the recipe put some filter water into a saucepan with a tight lid about 2 cup you ll measure it later when you add cold water or that is to cool it down add 4 t ground coffee bean bring to a boil boil for 3 minute I turn it down to a low boil and since the stove is electric I turn it down to simmer after 2 minute so it is ready for the lid put the lid on and let it simmer for 15 minute strain into a coffee carafe or other glass jar at least a quart size add filter water and that is cube to cool it and to make a quart I also add a few drop of liquid mineral since enemas tend to take mineral out of your body the therapy I use a fleet enema bottle nice and small and easy to keep clean and to replace those big red enema bag come from china and are hard to clean you can buy an enema bucket if you feel like it I prefer the fleet it is easy to hold 4 oz of liquid lube the tip with a good oil and insert you can lay down assume the knee and chest down position or just bend over at the waist roll the bottle as it empty like roll the tube of toothpaste hold for 12 minute and release repeat until the coffee is all use up after the first insertion and empty if you re in a hurry you can put a couple of bottle in at once as the first time will empty the colon and make room for more that is about it rinse the bottle out when you re do and the tip and let they dry for the next time do not leave coffee in the bottle if you re concerned as I am about plastic leaching fill it and use the content right away there will be a little left in the bottom of the bottle not a big deal for I but you can take the lid off and let air in and empty it all the way or you can leave enough air at the top when you fill the bottle to get all the coffee out the first time and if you eat the food take the supps and do the coffee think how much help you ll be give your liver no but about it laugh out loud oh almost

first of all I am not sure if this is a a lung issuea or an a ocd issue a my wife and I are try to sell our house and as we are of limited financial mean I undertake to handle some update minor remodeling myself one of the project was instal ceramic tile over a 20 square foot area I remove 2 layer of old tile until I get down to the sub flooring which was cover with a layer of black adhesive there are 2 safety issue concern potential hazard that have result from this 1 I power saw a 40a x 0625a piece of cement board which contain 25 respirable crystalline silica which is a carcinogena indoor with my two little girl in the adjacent room this create a surprising amount of dust I didna t realize that it was harmful until later in the afternoon after I research it a bit 2 one of the layer of tile that I remove was of the 1960a s vinyl asbestos variety from what I understand while not as dangerous as pure asbestos or asbestos insulation asbestos floor tile present a potential health hazard the black adhesive was also augment with asbestos I go to the emergency room along with my daughter after the sawing incident and the er doctor say that there was no concern of any of we develop a long term lung illness such as cancer from the cement dust he say a youa d get this amount of exposure just walk down the street a also after I realize that the tile contain asbestos I contact my doctor and my daughtersa pediatrician both say that the exposure was insignificant and a not to worry about it a I realize that asbestos and silica pose health risk mainly for people whose occupation involve daily exposure to they however I can not stop worry that we are all go to get sick I should say that I was diagnose as have ocd anxiety about 10 year ago so it is hard for I to determine if my concern paranoia is unfounded and irrational or if it is legitimate part of the reason I think my concern might be legitimate is because there was indeed harmful matter in the housea albeit a small amounta and because er doctor gpa s and pediatrician are not pulmonologist maybe they were wrong,neutral,0

daily checkup alcohol still risk but viral hepatitis fatty liver disease main cause of cirrhosis by katie charles read more http www nydailynews com lifestyle health 2010 07 14 2010 07 14_daily_checkup_alcohol_still_risk_but_viral_hepatitis_fatty_liver_disease_main_ca html ixzz0u0uqy57o the specialist dr scott friedman on cirrhosis as the chief of the division of liver disease at mount sinai scott friedman is a hepatologist who do research on how scar tissue form in the liver who s at risk fibrosis is a term doctor use to describe the scarring of the liver that build up over time as the result of liver damage over many year that scar progress and culminate in cirrhosis which refer to an end stage fibrosis say friedman by then the blood flow through the liver is impaired and liver function may be compromise a healthy liver have many vital function like detoxify the blood synthesize critical protein and hormone fight off infection and metabolizing sugar fat and protein advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are major public health concern that dramatically increase your chance of develop liver cancer liver cancer is the fast rise cancer in the you s and the third lead cause of cancer mortality worldwide say friedman the bulk of patient with cirrhosis in this country have it from hepatitis b or c about 5 3 million americans are live with chronic viral hepatitis the second lead cause of fibrosis is call fatty liver disease in which fat accumulate in the liver and eventually lead to scar obese patient often overlook the risk of liver damage say friedman obesity often go hand in hand with metabolic syndrome which is associate with elevated blood lipid and blood pressure insulin resistance and pro thrombotic and an inflammatory state fatty liver disease often improve after weight loss regimen like bariatric surgery the underlying cause for fibrosis can also be alcohol abuse or rare condition like autoimmune disease of the liver alcohol abuse is definitely a risk factor but the vast majority of patient with fibrosis and cirrhosis do not abuse alcohol say friedman the old association link cirrhosis solely with alcohol abuse no long hold true now that viral hepatitis and fatty liver disease are the two primary cause of fibrosis and cirrhosis sign and symptom one of the challenge of diagnose and treat liver disease is that it most often develop stealthily the liver is so resilient that it can compensate for year of disease and the patient may have no symptom until the disease is very progress say friedman in reality many patient have advanced fibrosis but have no symptom the very late manifestation of symptom mean that it is even more important to identify if people are at risk and screen they to catch the disease early people at high risk of liver disease include asian immigrant who are more prone to hepatitis b and patient with evidence of metabolic syndrome who are at high risk of fatty liver disease say friedman other risk factor for hepatitis include people who get blood transfusion before 1990 and people who engage in high risk behavior like needle share alcohol abuse is still a risk factor even if it is no long the most common underlying cause new evidence show that simple blood test can do an excellent job of identify a patient risk of liver disease we screen for alt alanine aminotransferase an enzyme that enter the bloodstream if the liver is damage say friedman an elevated alt level without explanation merit followup traditional treatment we have no treatment approve to attack the scarring in the liver yet say friedman but we have some excellent treatment for the underlie disease there are effective medical therapy for hepatitis b and c for hepatitis b the main drug are molecule that block the multiplication of the virus say friedman the hepatitis c treatment are a combination of the drug interferon and an immunomodulatory drug call ribavarin which together boost the immune system to fight the virus new drug that attack the hepatitis c virus directly are expect to be available next year for patient with fatty liver disease weight loss regimen also reduce liver damage anything from diet and exercise and medication to bariatric surgery can have great result say friedman if alcohol abuse is the underlying cause patient are usually require to enroll in a 12 step rehab program once the liver disease progress to the point of impair liver function doctor treat the result symptom we try to treat all the liver problem and screen for liver cancer say friedman for select patient liver transplantation may be necessary but doctor hope they can help more patient control their liver damage before it get to that point there is now evidence that if we treat the underlie liver disease even cirrhosis is reversible say friedman doctor are make liver disease an increasingly manageable illness through prevention early detection and the treatment of fibrosis before it progress too far research breakthrough some of the most exciting liver disease research is being do at the molecular level in 1985 friedman identify the cell type that s responsible for the formation of scar tissue basically we ve go from uncover what cause scar formation to soon being able to treat and prevent fibrosis with medication say friedman our hope is that if we develop new treatment for fibrosis well be able to prevent the development of cirrhosis question for your doctor hepatitis is a major public health risk so be proactive about ask your doctor am I at risk of hepatitis follow up with should I be vaccinate for hepatitis a and b another good question is do I have any risk factor for liver disease and is my alt elevate what you can do know your risk level that mean know the risk factor of liver disease especially hepatitis and fatty liver disease and know your alt level if your alt level is abnormal on even one reading you should have it follow up say dr scott friedman get inform the american liver foundation have great patient information on support service and advocacy see www liverfoundation org see a specialist if there s evidence of chronic liver disease base on virus or blood test see a liver specialist say friedman support liver disease research its a terribly underfunded research area say friedman who recommend give to the american association for the study of liver disease at www aasld org read more http www nydailynews com lifestyle health 2010 07 14 2010 07 14_daily_checkup_alcohol_still_risk_but_viral_hepatitis_fatty_liver_disease_main_ca html

I receive google alert in my mail about fatty liver this is one article I receive today and its saddening to say myself I wish they put out warning and scare tactic to say this will happen and this will happen if you gain weight or take this med they have finally warn we about tylenol and how bad it is for the liver but back to the article it is post below liver line november 27 2009 write by david bernstein md facp facg friday 27 november 2009 10 51 fatty liver continue to be the most prevalent liver disease in america while affect more than 50 million americans most with this condition will have a benign course and will not develop significant liver disease a small percentage however will develop inflammation and scar in the liver in addition to just fat deposition when these finding are present they are indicative of more advanced liver disease and the condition is call non alcoholic steatohepatitis or nash nash can lead to cirrhosis and its complication include liver cancer and in certain circumstance a liver transplantation may be need as americans grow large and this condition increase in prevalence we can expect to see significantly great morbidity and mortality from this condition current estimate are that 2 4 percent of people with fatty liver will develop nash this mean that one to two million americans are at risk for develop cirrhosis and its complication from this condition how non alcoholic fatty liver develop remain unclear we do know that alcohol use lead to fat within the liver which can progress to cirrhosis in non drinker the mechanism is uncertain some theory revolve around insulin resistance however many non insulin resistant people develop nash the lead predispose factor to the development of nash appear to be diabetes and obesity people with these condition and abnormal liver test are more likely to progress to more advanced disease the real question that need to be answer is how good to treat nash the most commonly prescribe therapy for nash is diet exercise and weight loss although this regimen make overall good sense study have not show that mild weight loss alone change the course of fatty liver bariatric surgery with significant weight loss have been show to lessen fat within the liver and even reverse cirrhosis in some case many people with fatty liver are place on ursodeoxycholic acid to normalize the liver enzyme although this therapy is widely use the jury is still out regard its effectiveness many clinical trial with a handful of patient have not show promise with medication such as clofibrate a lipid lower agent and metformin and the thiazolidinedione diabetes medicine for the treatment of nash vitamin e have been use in the treatment of nash with some study show a small improvement in the amount of fat present a recent study present at the meeting of the american association for the study of liver disease in november 2009 show that daily vitamin e use at a dose of 800 mg a day for one year in non diabetic patient with nash result in less fat cell within the liver than comparator arm with pioglitazone or placebo there was no improvement in scar at the end of the year with vitamin e use the prevalence of nash is increase and unfortunately so will its complication the only way to stop this epidemic is to watch what we eat and hopefully not develop diabetes or obesity if nash occur diet and exercise remain the mainstay of therapy in the non diabetic patient with nash it seem reasonable to start vitamin e dr bernstein is the director of hepatology for the north shore long island jewish health system you may write to dr bernstein c o anton community newspaper 132 e second street mineola ny 11501 or email dbernste nshs eduthis e mail address is being protect from spambot you need javascript enable to view it disclaimer the view and opinion represent are those of the author and mean for informative purpose only for your specific question consult your physician,neutral,0

I go to al anon I have hear all of the argument but I have a real problem call alcoholism a disease alcoholism is nothing like cancer as it is often liken to I know they are not say its identical but what I mean is that I believe it is a slap in the face to all those who suffer from a disease like cancer or diabete or lupus or you fill in the blank I personally think it is a copout and give fuel to as that they can not help it do they have a genetic disposition towards alcoholism maybe but there is not any evidence in my husband case that this is true even so if there is a genetic predisposition it still come down to choice no people do not start out choose to become alcoholic to become addicted but they do choose to deal with life through the bottle and that is a fact not a disease I just get so frustrated hear the likeness to disease I care for my grandmother 12 year ago who have a brain tumor and pass I also care for my mother who die from bone cancer alcoholism do not in any way shape or form resemble what I witness with these lady I love dearly they do not choose a way of life that cause their cancer unlike the alcoholic that choose to find his her strength from the bottle and end up with liver issue and can die from it or die because they get behind a wheel and crash no similarity whatsoever in my mind to I there is not one iota of common sense to that line of thought,negative,-1

hello I have been research for a month or more and figure I might as well post I am currently 8 month pregnant due beginning of october for a few month I have been have some problem with bowel movement my first symptom was some blood on the stool itself and a little on the toilet paper it is never been a lot but concern to say the least it have always been bright red I go to doctor and he say probably hemorrhoid due to pregnancy I ask he to confirm and so he do a proctoscope and he see internal hemorrhoid not long after that appointment I start notice thin stool mucus on the stool and sometimes I would go to have a bowel movement and would just have bloody type mucus before the stool I have not have any abnormal pain I ask the doctor at my next appointment for something unrelated about the thin stool and again he was not concerned because of the hemorrhoid I am 26 year old and never have any problem before like 3 4 month pregnant my stool is not form hard ball it is normal color just small with mucus and blood at time not all bowel movement have blood and mucus more when I strain a little and then a day or two after my mom is stage 4 breast cancer and to be honest anything that go wrong with I I instantly tell myself it is probably cancer so a bit paranoid do anyone have any reassurance that this is more than likely cause by the hemorrhoid and pregnancy and not cancer I am under the assumption that there really is not anymore test since proctoscope do until after pregnancy thank you so much for listen it is hard feel like there could be something seriously wrong and not being able to know for sure is it a good sign that the doctor do see the hemorrhoid thank tylette,neutral,0

I hope that someone will please answer since I am desperate with worry and can not stop cry I have been downright stupid I will admit I am 62 and have never have a colonoscopy out of fear of the anesthesia neither colon cancer nor polyp run in my family and I have lab do every 6 month last time 2 week ago and everything was completely normal so I have not worry much about the colonoscopy however over the past couple of year I have have very light pink blood 2 or 3 time only on the toilet paper after an urgent bm and twice a tiny bit or red blood again on the paper I have small hemorrhoid but do not know if this is what cause the bleeding the reason why I feel so anxious is because a couple of month ago I start feel a light but nevertheless worrisome sensation which I think was due to a small left ovarian cyst an on and off momentary cramp or twinge in that area but after ultrasound my gyn tell I that the cyst is too small and per the radiologist benign and recommend that I have a colonoscopy I have never eat much fiber but have always been pretty regular I am now terrify because I have increase my fiber significantly and the frequency of bowel movement that I have should be much more than what I am have they are pasty and not as thick as they use to be sorry about the detail and do not come every day I do not feel as if I have go enough and the sensation on the left side is now more frequent and strong I eat a very low fat diet due to gallbladder issue but lead a very sedentary life and am a totally depressed mess do any of you think this could be colon cancer have you have similar symptom what was your diagnosis if you were diagnose with cancer how long ago if you are old like I any problem with the procedure or anesthesia I have an appointment with a gi doctor in a couple of week and I imagine well schedule a colonoscopy I am so afraid that I have waste the life that god so generously give I,negative,-1

I go to a rectal doctor on monday for a concern I have that turn out to be nothing but in talk with he about colonoscopy we realize we have a problem or rather I do and I am not sure what to do about it I am on coumadin blood thin for a clotting disorder have been for 25 year and have a virtual colonoscopy last year so I would not have to go off of it well in talk with the colon doctor monday I say I really want to have a regular one next time and say I was aware I would have to go off the coumadin 3 4 day beforehand no big deal I have have two minor surgurie in the past and have to stop it then too I just go back on it immediately afterwards my alarm was evident though when he say and if I remove any polyp I will have to keep you off of it for about 10 day because of the bleeding I am sure the color drain from my face and I say I can not do that he explain that he have other patient who are on it and say that of course he have to take they off of it if he do surgery he have no choice but my belief is if he is do colon surgery on these people chance are they are also old if they are on a blood thin and many of they are probably take it for heart condition not a clotting disorder my chance of get a clot while off of it is very scary to I and I am just completely lose as to what to do I really do not give it alot of thought at first as I was just relieve to find out my original problem was nothing but the more I think about it the more concerned I become as eventually I am go to have to decide what to do my question is have anyone else on here have a similar problem and if so what do you do I think if I was young I probably would not worry as much about being off of it but because I am a little old now 52 chance of stroke and the like start become a little risky as it do for everybody when they age I know I can talk with my blood doctor but what I am ask all of you is if anyone else have have a similar problem and how you deal with it thank so much,negative,-1

hi everyone this have been a tough past two week for I mainly because of the uncertainty I have been worry myself to death and I have to wait another week to see a specialist I go to two doctor recently and both just tell I it was probably hemerrhoids without examination I have to take the initiative and call a specialist on my own I am 24 year old and have have the follow symptom about two week ago I begin have blood on my toilet paper none on stool along with a sharp pain on the rectum when the stool first come out I just think it was because of a tear or hemorrhoid the bleeding last about 4 5 day but then I begin to have other symptom which begin to worry I first and foremost were the thinness of my stool for a few day it was really thin about half an inch round the stool was loose so a few minute in the toilet the stool begin to loose shape I begin to up my fiber intake and then my stool begin to bulk up a little but they were still a bit thin about an inch tall and about three quarter of an inch thick sorry for the specific I also begin to have a dull ache on the left buttock not right at the anus but more diffused not really painful or bothersome but it was noticeable that s pretty much go now but another thing that s been bother I is low back ache its sometimes in the middle and sometimes more on the left side its only occasional when I sit in a particular way or when I am stand for long period of time its get a little bit well the past few day I go to the bathroom regularly every morning no abdominal pain and no consitpation nor diarrhea I notice flatter stool once before last year but the stool go back to regular shape after a few week I am not sure how long it take or what I do to make it go away I might have take laxative I have have two fecal occult blood exam do over the past eight month for other reason not at all relate to cancer and both come back negative my last blood result have normal blood count I have basically read everything I could online and I know the blood and thin stool can be a sign of cancer I know that its unlikely for someone my age to have colon cancer but from read post here and on other site it definitely do occur I have no history of cancer in my family so now that I have write this book I just have a few question do these symptom apply to you when you were diagnose do anyone else have low back pain that was directly relate to the colon cancer I read on one site that low back pain could be the cancer metastisizing to the bone if so was it constant or positional and how painful if my thin stool happen before and then return to normal could this mean it might be a different disorder like ibs if it turn out to be cancer would these symtom be suggestive of advanced stage iii stage iv cancer I am terrify right now I have kidney failure when I was 21 and just have a transplant 6 month ago because of immunosuppresant I am not sure how chemo or radiation would work for I I would probably have to lose the kidney I do not know if I could take have kidney failure and cancer at the same time I just want some answer but I guess I have to wait until next monday thank for any advice answer and so on I really appreciate it and I am glad I find this board tom,negative,-1

were go to inpatient I to an off site psych place but then decide to just let I go home I have been able to sleep and eat a little since come home but I am barely hold myself together I just do not know what all this stuff mean for I and send message to my dr that take day back and forth is not help I would be so very much appreciate if some might take some of their time to help I understand cope well than I have been I am a 41yr old female I am considerably overweight 40 bmi which is a constant struggle with pcos I have lead a very sedentary life after tear the cartilage in both knee a few year ago but I should have find something that do not hurt rather than throw up my hand and sit on my I have pretty severe anxiety I do not use to be bad at all until a few year ago when I was convinced I die after sinus surgery I likely pass out or simply feel asleep but I was utterly convinced I die and was unable to sleep for day at a time afterwards it flare now and then under stress my dr think it cause ptsd and health anxiety I was give xanax to take as need I do not drink I do not smoke I do not use drug I do not have any heath problem really until this liver stuff well yeah maybe I do but it is something that was just being look into right before the liver stuff come into focus start late april I have a month long about with abdominal issue I have never have before bloat quick to feel full loss of appetite frequent bms some heartburn by the time I get into see the gastro doc take a month the symptom have abate I literally only see he for 3 min he do not do any sort of exam he tell I I have acid reflux and to take this pill he was give I for a month and come back I was terribly disappointed in that whole experience my primary doctor have run blood work on may 1st and although my liver enzyme have been elevate they were still within so I guess she do not say anything I guess the gastro doc do not think much of it either bc he do not say anything either may 1st alt 15 78 you l 72 ast 9 44 you l 45 alp 37 127 you l 90 bilirubin total 0 0 1 2 mg dl 1 1 the previous time my blood work have been do was in june 2015 alt 26 ast 22 alp 94 bilirubin total 1 2 so you can see the alt and ast a considerable elevation from what it have been previously I have a routine physical on july 3rd the enzyme have increase slightly more alt 82 ast 45 alp 81 bilirubin totoal 1 3 this time she flag it and leave I a message she want I to come back in two week for a retest I google why enzyme would be elevate I read about nafld and nash nash send I out of my mind I keep have panic attack my xanax was not help with I could not sleep I keep have the thought of if I sleep I will die like happen back a few year ago I was a mess I call the office and beg for a liver ultrasound now rather than make I suffer like this for 2 more week for a retest which will prob just lead to an ultrasound anyway I also tell they I start to have right quad pain in the last few day that was not go away so she order it and I go that night for blood work not sure why the blood work it have only been a few day since I have it and a full abdominal ultrasound I was hysterical at the test and the tech feel so bad she try to calm I say that she do not see anything so bad only some gallstone and a fatty liver I guess she think I was worried about cancer but oddly I was not it is nash that is terrify I well after hear for sure I do have a fatty liver I lose my freaking mind I could not get nash out of my head I do not no one do want to end up on some liver transplant list in a few year with end liver disease I can not convey to you the just true utter terror this have strike in I and my anxiety med are not help after come home from the ultrasound I lose it I end up at the emergency room when I start to scare my husband this was more than a typical panic attack I beg they to please sedate I so I could sleep I was so exhausted I have only have like 2hrs in 3 night they give I fluids bc I was dehydrate something to calm I and call a social worker to work with they in put I into some off site inpatient place maybe I am being a baby but I truly can not help it I would not do this to myself if I have a choice I know I am being irrational at time but that do not make it stop anyway they decide not to inpatient I and send I home whatever they give I finally allow I to sleep I have been able to eat since then but my appetite is definitely diminish I have immediately change my diet and start to walk a bit my exercise tolerance is pretty low so I will have to work up to more and more step I walk 2 5 mile yesterday but I think that is maybe push it after having sit for so long and I really still have not been eat too much I do not want to make this bad and I have read you can do if you lose too much weight too quickly my doctor finally personally call I after her nurse who is a sweetheart find out I have been in the hospital my doctor try to tell I that sooooo many people have fatty liver and this is a new condition for I since there was no indication of it back in 2015 she say that is good bc it was not much time to cause damage she say fatty liver is almost always reverse with a healthy die and exercise she say my level are only slightly elevate so it is not a dire concern right today she say if she have been worry that of course she would have say so but she really is not at this time even after the ultrasound she say she hope that see my gastro doctor next week to talk about thing in more detail will make I feel well she say the pain I am have in my side and back and even the elevated enzyme could easily be from the gallstone see on ultrasound she keep say try not to worry and that she will do what she can to help get I into some behavioral therapy for my anxiety bc it is clear the med alone are not enough I have a panic attack while talk to she she is ask I to try to calmly tell she what I am so scared of I tell her nash it is literally terrify I she try to calm I with rational thing like it is such a small chance and all that but really she can not know right now if I have it or not so I really could not be calm very much I have been barely hold it together I do not see the gastro until the thursday of this upcoming week that is like an eternity to someone with severe anxiety I really do not know how I am go to manage until then I have been try to hold onto the fact that gallstone bc that is a relatively easy fix right could cause my enzyme to be elevate but alp is commonly also in my case it is not shortly before both test I have very very bad back pain that radiate out from under my right shoulder that I have no idea the cause of the last few day I have have this dull but constant ache at my right waist level reach a little to the front and back off and on for week few month I get this bit sharp pain in my right side that do not last but I was chalk it up to poor posture do that seem to be gallbladder

hi everyone I am fairly new to the board but just need to vent today I was diagnose with bowel cancer in 2003 and have chemo radiotherapy and then surgery ileostomy then follow up chemo eventually the cancer spread to the liver which I have remove last july but unfortunately my surgeon was unable to get it all as it was in the lymph gland and nodes anyway I have been in horrific chronic pain lately and I have some exploratory surgery do two week ago a biopsy was take and come back positive for cancer back in the rectum I have not really been happy with the treatment I have been receive from my oncologist or surgeon and so I start a search to find the good of the good which to cut a long story short I find and go to see today he find that I have cancer around the anus and far up and at the site of the first operation in order to remove it he would have to remove my rectum vagina bladder uterus and I would be leave with 3 bag rather than the one I already have he also say that he would not want to do the surgery as it is difficult very big surgery and at least 6 month recovery plus I would lose quality of life and the main reason is that the cancer have spread and there is no cure for it now they can only hope to palliate I to buy I a little time in less pain I am so sad I am only just turn 39 and I have a little 6 year old boy who adore I and I he we really have the most special bond you could have as mother and son I do not have long to go perhaps 12 18 month at a guess and I can not bear the thought of leave he I am separate from his dad and my little boy do not see his dad all that much they do have a relationship but it could be a whole lot well he will not feel secure have to go and live with his dad who by the way have make it clear will not move down here so jack could stay at his own school with his own friend and family but he will move he up where he live 1 1 2 hour away regardless of what is good for jack so not only do jack lose his mum he also lose his home his school his friend and neighbour and family member from down this way the one thing that stand out in my mind apart from everything this brilliant surgeon say to I was that he believe naturopathy is well worth a go as he believe it will prolong my life somewhat so I am of course go to give this everything I have get to give and also do positive thinking and every other alternative thing I can possibly do so who know maybe I will at least last a few more year than what they predict I hope so as I really can not bear to leave my son please pray for I and send positive vibe to the universe as I can use all the help and support I can get also feel free to speak with I as I love get to know people and also help other if I can thank for let I waffle on so long here and get this off my chest,positive,1

I have not post for awhile but last week we get my mom second ct result since start the tarceva in jan 2005 for nsclc the first ct show dramatic improvement the 2nd ct show some slight growth in some of the liver met but the lung is stable dr is think the tarceva may no long be work and want she to consider more chemo but my mom feel great right now so want to hold off on the chemo and who can blame she as at 81 yrs the 2nd line chemo could be very difficult and even kill she so why not enjoy the good day while you still have they I have hear chemo in stage iv is to treat symptom and since she have none I support her decision besides she finally have hair again after loose it to first line chemo she want to stay on the tarceva and get another scan in another month or two and see if yes the cancer is progrese or if that was a fluke she have to go off the tarceva for 1 5weeks 6 week prior to the ct due to an allergic reaction that turn out to not be to the tarceva so is wonder if the growth could have happen during that time I also read that when allergy problem exist it can over burden the immune system and allow cancer to grow so maybe that is responsible time will tell I am also check into the cyberknife as if the next ct come back show that the lung remain stable but the liver met have grow more maybe cyberknife is the way to go the good news is she feel so great and is out live a life again even go to work 2 morning a week she is able to walk long distance and is eat well not bad for an 81 yr old I hope everyone I have share post with in the past are hang in there and do well we are just a few week short of being at the year mark and believe I a year ago I do not expect she to make it for a year as the doctor make it sound like 1 year would be push her luck show you what they know my thought are with all of you in your battle with nsclc,negative,-1

I am not to sure what I am ask for here but I do know that I need help just over two week ago a man I love and was in love with pass away suddenly he was early 30 and have only been ill a short time he was diagnose with cancer on the friday and move to a hospice and die on the follow tuesday the pain I am feel is almost unbearable for many reason which I hope you will not judge I for I begin work with s almost a year ago and we become close friend very quickly there was an amazing connection and we just love being in each other company as time go by we get close and I find myself talk about he outside work we would often be in contact in the evening and the weekend and he quickly become my good friend rather than being my colleague and boss I think I need to tell you now that I am openly gay s was marry with two child I never pursue anything with s but it was pretty obvious that we enjoy each other company in early december last year s take I by surprise and tell I how he feel about I although I feel the same I try to fight the attraction as I know he have a family but with we spend so much time together it was impossible he never want to hurt his family but he tell I how much he care for I and want we to have a future together he torture himself through christmas and agonise about what he should do next during december he was also lose weight and have some stomach pain but I think he and I just put this down to the stress of the situation in january he tell I he want to be with I but feel that he need to give it one last try with his wife so that he could look at his child in the future and tell they he try he want to do the right thing which I understand I love he and understand this although at the time I was quite distant as I was hurt a few day later he get some test result from the gp that indicate the possibility of a secondary cancer on his liver when he tell I we do not mention our relationship but just focusse on get his diagnosis treatment and how I would do everything I could to support he through his illness two week later he was admit to hospital he would been wait 2 week for a referral for mri scan with stomach pain after he leave work I visit he once in hospital he would visibly lose weight and I have to help he sit up in bed which shock I we talk about mundane stuff I do not say anything about how much I love he or how much he mean to I I do not want he to know how worried I was or for he to think or even consider he might die which I think he would if I would tell he I love he as if I was say goodbye in the last few week s buy I a key ring with a map of the town I am buy my first flat in on he was very excited for I he also text I to give I his favourite book that was on his book shelf at work follow this he have two week of test which initially prove inconclusive but cancer was then diagnose s have keep in contact via text throughout but do not tell I how serious thing were just that he was have a couple of hard day that his dad was stay with he and that I should not worry his wife contact work two day after his last text to I to say he would passed away from a very aggressive cancer my world have been turn upside down although nothing was for sure I would dreamt of a potential future we might have together the guilt I have feel over what have happen and the question ss wife may have have over his change in behaviour over the last few month have also been a concern despite the fact that I am not ashamed over what happen it would serve no purpose for she to find out what happen I have have to tell a few friend to help they understand what I am go through I am in agony work have been utterly horrendous though s run my division and I am now in charge I love work because of he and I am not ready to lead the team or feel in any position to do this because of the grief and turmoil I am go to I have never really have to deal with bereavement before but I think I could have deal with lose someone I love but lose someone I am in love with seem like the bad thing that could have ever happen the feeling of loss and the wondering of what could have been are unbearable I can not understand why these thing happen and can not understand what high force would allow this to happen I am not religious and neither was s but do not believe that religion could be of any comfort during this time I feel guilty about the pain I am go though as it can not even compare to the pain his wife and child are go through or his parent I do not feel I am entitle to any legitimate feeling of grief I am almost start to feel that I do not care about my life if I die tomorrow next week next year it do not matter I keep wonder what happen when we die I worry that he was in pain and that he was scared and I could not help he I was not there I attend the funeral last week which was very hard and I cry throughout people know I am struggle at the loss of a friend but they do not know the extent of how much I am suffer I do not know what to do now I can not see beyond each day I want to feel close to s but I have not get anything of his physically I would like to get in contact with his wife or family but I think this is impossible I speak to ss dad at the funeral and he was lovely say he would heard a lot about I I can not sleep and am have nightmare all the time he truly was a beautiful man I love and I can not bare to live without I know he would think that was crazy talk but I do not think he truly understand the depth of feeling I have for he I never have the perfect final conversation and I can not bare to think that he have go forever and that I will never see he again hear his voice feel his touch I also worry that I will forget he I can not ever know what might have happen but idealistically I now look back and believe thing could have been perfect this make the sense of loss even worse I suddenly feel very insecure s look after I at work and I know he would be in my life support I in some capacity forever I think I take he and his support for grant although I do tell he many time via text what he mean to I it never cross my mind in the last year though that I would lose he so quickly I do not know what type of help or support you can give but I need to say all those thing and have someone else hear they,very negative,-2

I do not expect to get much of a response to this post because for most people it may either be too embarrassing or too private of a matter to talk about year of drinking may have damage my body in way I may never know or will one day soon find out however there are other physical sign and symptom that appear to be the direct result of the manner I choose to deal with anxiety and stress for more than 15 year one example of this is that I appear to have some sort of malabsorption disorder with my stool being very light in color very very light brown and with many of my bowel movement that float due to the fat content my bowel movement also have the same smell that I associate with either bile or stomach acid I have occasionally taste in my mouth in the middle of the night after go to bed too early after eat a meal in the come month I plan to have my stool test for its fat content and ph level which is something that many gastroenterologist do not do anymore because of the expense involve I also plan to get test for any vitamin deficiency I may have a recent ct scan and laboratory work suggest that I am not deal with pancreatitis nor pancreatic cancer for the time being however this do not necessarily rule out that these symptom are not due to some type of pancreatic enzyme deficiency I am include a valuable link to an article about malaborption disorder which provide numerous scenario that can lead to fatty stool http www helium com item 1524484 cause of intestinal malabsorption one of the many sign and symptom of list on numerous information website about alcoholic liver disease describe patient have either light colored pale white or gray stool while pale stool is often list as a symptom for alcoholic liver disease it appear that most clinician do not rely too heavily on its diagnosis because what people eat can also play a significant role in both the color and fat content of stool in the meantime are any of you willing to talk about what color your stool was at the time of your diagnosis and whether it was fatty do it float or not and for those who believe alcohol was the direct or indirect cause of any stool change have any of these symptom revolve from several month of abstain from alcohol for those who have hepatitis or cirrhosis not relate to alcohol do you have these symptom thank you in advance to those who are willing to share this very personal information which may be embarrassing to talk about sincerely jeff I plan to post a version of this post in the alcoholism support group by the way this friday october 23rd will mark two month of I being completely sober just like many of you who have been diagnose with alcohol induce cirrhosis have I know how daily drink even amount as little as 3 to 4 drink per day can damage the human body I would have never resort to this as my principal cope strategy in attempt to manage stress and anxiety in my life for so many year,negative,-1

triple tx for post liver transplant hey marilyn this is the article kat was refer to yesterday postliver transplantation patient with recurrent hcv this case is a 58 year old white woman who receive liver transplantation in 2009 she is being maintain on tacrolimus immunosuppression and is receive multiple concurrent medication for comorbiditie her creatinine is 1 4 mg dl she have recurrent genotype 1 hcv a biopsy perform 3 year after transplantation show grade 2 inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis what would you recommend for this patient jordan j feld md mile per hour this is a difficult case she already have f2 fibrosis and we certainly know that fibrosis can progress rapidly post transplantation 36 I would be concern that if we do not think about therapy soon she will run into trouble on the other hand there are challenge with treat she we could assume that among her concurrent medication are tacrolimus or cyclosporine which will complicate current treatment 37 moreover her creatinine is already mildly elevate if treatment is pursue it should be do by an experienced clinician therapeutic drug monitoring would need to be perform if a pi were to be concomitantly administer with tacrolimus or cyclosporine to ensure level are appropriate however I think I would err on the side of consider treatment for her michael w fry md safety is certainly a concern in these patient this is an area that have been inadequately study until recently numerous case series document the treatment of small number of post transplant patient are now being report 38 39 the big safety issue for these patient appear to be anemia these patient almost universally require erythropoietin and several have receive blood transfusion they often have some renal insufficiency which will contribute to ribavirin associate anemia the addition of a pi would add far to the risk of anemia in addition manage the immunosuppressant therapy is also particularly challenge due to potential drugdrug interaction there are some datum to suggest that simeprevir tmc435 do not have the same drugdrug interaction potential with tacrolimus and cyclosporine as do the first generation protease inhibitor 40 stefan zeuzem md to consider treatment for this patient it is urgent that she is willing and able to come to the office 1 2 time per week for monitoring of drug level hemoglobin and clinical issue mark s sulkowski md monitoring is an important aspect of start treatment for any of these complex patient during the past year and a half we have all learn to monitor patient quite closely when we are concerned about toxicity of current therapy that monitoring require frequent laboratory analysis and visit in summary for patient in the post transplantation set a reason to treat is the substantial risk of progressive liver disease a challenge with treating is the complicated drugdrug interaction with both cyclosporine and tacrolimus however these can be manage when experience clinician are involve close monitoring is clearly an important aspect hope this is helpful respectfully henry,neutral,0

hi my father have to be readmitte to the hospital a few day ago it was approximately 5 week after his rectal cancer surgery and 3 week after his initial release he was readmitte due to sign of dehydration and an alarming amount of bloat in his abdomen after various test include a cat scan they confirm that his abdomen was fill with lymphatic fluid approximately 3 liter they promptly remove 1 liter by tap his stomach they were hesitant to remove any more due to an increase risk of infection since this fluid was remove 3 day ago even more fluid have return we are all alarmed by how much his abdoman have expand he look 6 7 month pregnant it is put great pressure on his rib and he is in constant discomfort have anyone experience this during their recovery from surgery my father is still under the care of his surgeon he have explain how the release of lymphatic fluid is likely due to two suspicious node that were remove the tissue have not heal yet and will continue to release fluid until it heal on its own they can not give we a time frame they have put a pic line in his before midday and have start to give he a special nutrition feed that will hopefully facilitate a reduction in the bloat I am just wonder whether we should be seek the advice of a specialist if so what kind of specialist I can not help but wonder what effect this severe bloating might be have on his major organ lung heart kidney and so on I am desperate for help update I have since learn that his condition was diagnose as chylous ascite it appear to be a very rare condition from what I have read on line due to its rarity very little information is available on line probably no one from this board have experience this but perhaps I would be grateful for any advice,neutral,0
my question is if a doctor find a lung nodule on the ct scan how come all they want to do is monitor it why do not they just remove it and be do with it instead of having put the patient thru ct scan every six month for two or more year to make sure it is not cancerous it do not make sense remove the nodule when spot on the ct scan and lower the chance of that person have to undergo needless amount of radation just confused on their method,neutral,0

I have been research endo and read everything I can find on the topic in an effort to help myself and avoid a 5th surgery hysterectomy I want to share some of my finding that everyone with endo should know my finding in a nut shell endometriosis is an estrogen dominant disease endometriosis feed on estrogen if you have too much estrogen in your body it is create an environment to support more endo to grow your liver process out extra estrogen if your liver is congest it will not work as hard to remove the estrogen look up how to do a liver flush this is helpful many patient with endo have low progesterone progesterone help to balance estrogen and low it take a natural progesterone cream or oil that is apply to your skin be careful of what cream you choose some have estrogen and paraben in they avoid these the good I find is progestelle I get it online you may feel bad for a few month before you see improvement also you should aviod xenoestrogens for a while before you start it avoid xenoestrogens they are chemical that mimic estrogen in the body the liver can not process they out as well and they dramatically impact estrogen dominance they are find in cosmetic lotion soaps paint plastic herbacide pesticide and more go natural it is not easy to find these product that are free of xenoestrogens the big one I focus on is avoid paraben in my personal care product what you eat is process through the liver that s why the liver flush is so helpful to help the body get rid of estrogen the problem with the xenoestrogens is that they come into the body through the skin what go on your skin do not get process through the liver and go directly into your system seek out paraben free product and protect yourself if you are garden eat organic veggie vegetable are grow with many pesticide and unnatural fertilizer that contain xenoestrogens at least wash your veggie very well if you can not buy organic avoid commercial milk and dairy in the us we use the bovine growth hormone in our dairy cow nasty stuff not approve in any other developed nation helpful also to avoid commercially grow beef chicken and pork product do not heat up food in plastic container this is the 1 for I I heat up my food in glass bowel with a paper towel over it when you heat plastic it release the chemical into your food the effect of environmental toxin and xenoestrogen are still under study in the mean time many serious disease are occur not just endo but breast cancer have been on the rise same estrogen dominance issue man are grow breast boy genital are not develop very young girl are get period while I was at my specialist office I hear they take a call ask if they could treat a pediatric patient that is 5 year old for endo even more surprising was the answer that the young they have treat is 12,neutral,0

hope that we might see response like this but we in no way anticipate that within the context of a phase 1 clinical trial we would see this level of anti tumor activity say dr charles m rudin who author two paper on the finding that appear in the sept 2 online edition of the new england journal of medicine these are the first report in the literature of any hedgehog inhibitor being use clinically phase 1 trial are conduct to look at a drug safety profile and determine the right dose phase 2 and phase 3 trial typically look at effectiveness also exciting however is the fact that the hedgehog pathway have been implicate in other cancer notably colon cancer and ovarian cancer albeit in a different way researcher are go forward to look at the potential of the molecule know as gdc 0449 to treat these type of cancer as a one drug regiman and in combination with other drug for other solid tumor malignancy say rudin who is associate director for clinical research at the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at johns hopkins university in baltimore one expert note that find a compound that might control the hedgehog pathway could have far reach implication these are phase 1 trial so they are quite preliminary but the drug is quite effective in at least a subset of the patient treat say dr andrzej dlugosz author of an accompany editorial and a professor in the department of dermatology at the university of michigan medical school and comprehensive cancer center in ann arbor the reason were so excited is that there are now a large number of cancer that have also been link to abnormality in this pathway include pancreatic colon ovarian and prostate it is quite an impressive list the datum is pretty strong suggest that if you shut down the pathway it can have a pretty profound effect on those tumor cell if it can work in these cancer maybe it can work in other cancer even though the signal there is more complex but another researcher warn that it is premature to get too excited about the result it is great to see something with so much potential but it really is potential say dr clifford perlis director of mohs micrographic surgery and dermatologic surgery at fox chase cancer center in philadelphia however he add there are other company develop hedgehog inhibitor as well so I think people should be pay attention to this the hedgehog gene so name because it was first discover in fly with hair resemble the spike of hedgehog is really important during early embryonic development in pretty much all animal specie from fly to mouse to human and for pretty much every tissue you can imagine explain frederic de sauvage also an author on both paper but remarkably in adult it seem to be mostly turn off de sauvage is vice president of research molecular biology at genentech which develop the molecule and fund the study some 1 million americans get basal cell carcinoma each year it often do not spread but once it have there are no approve treatment medulloblastoma is an aggressive form of brain tumor the first trial enrol 33 individual whose basal cell carcinoma have spread locally or to distant organ half of the participant who have distant metastasis see a reduction in tumor size as do 60 percent of those with locally advanced cancer the rest have either stable or progressive disease after 10 month of follow up but stable in this population may not mean much perlis point out as it is generally a very slow grow cancer the man with medulloblastoma also see a significant shrinkage of his tumor along with vastly improved quality of life but only for two month he later die a third study by some of the same author this one publish online sept 2 in science express discover that treatment with gdc 0449 actually spur another mutation in a gene call smo which cause the brain tumor to become resistant to the drug because the hedgehog pathway do not actually do much in adult side effect were minimal say de sauvage gdc 0449 would likely be use very differently depend on which type of cancer it is target in the case of basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma the mutation in the hedgehog pathway really drive the formation of these tumor de sauvage say this molecule inhibit the pathway very specifically and to date we only know of these two type of tumor where the pathway is mutate that mean gdc 0449 is effective on its own but in colon and ovarian cancer he continue the pathway recruit surround cell to promote the cancer in these type of tumor gdc 0449 would have to be combine with other drug

I have surgery late last year and just complete 6 month of just in case chemo got scan a couple week ago and they detect edema of the mesentery and strand fat report say they could not rule out peritoneal carcinamatosis I have 2 doctor tell I do not worry well scan again in a couple month and it will probably go away I have a 3rd opinion from another oncologist who say he is concern and want to look close have anyone have this happen I was so ready to get that clear scan and could stop worry,negative,-1

the medcottage original intention was to allow family to care for age relative on their property but they can also be use for people with illness if a lyme patient relative could afford to purchase or rent one it could be a low income alternative for housing and relative can virtually monitor medicine usage and make sure the patient is not on the floor the lyme patient could still have a sense of autonomy just a thought http www roanoke com news roanoke welcome back 254181 a salem pastor idea for home care in a portable modular backyard unit is come to fruition with a prototype now on display

recently on the campus of hollin university the product is intend to accommodate family member in need of care while keep they close to home an idea to build a modular medical home that could be place in a caregiver back yard could be on the market by january salem base n2care the company responsible for invent the medcottage reveal its prototype for the specially equip portable house monday at the roanoke civic center medcottage would retail for between 65 000 and 75 000 at first with about 100 being make in 2011 n2care eventually plan to make the home available for lease at about 1 500 to 2 000 a month n2care plan to be profitable within three to six month of hit the market investor along with other supporter and medium tour the medcottage as n2care tout its invention as the way to meet the health care need of age baby boomer without have to rely on nursing home but the unit could be use by any person want some independence but in need of home medical care the prototype was dedicate to a 9 year old boy jason terpenny who die a decade ago from a virus after get leukemia the 12 by 24 foot home is the brainchild of the rev kenneth dupin pastor of salem wesleyan church who first think of the idea about four year ago I feel like this is as much a ministry as anything else I do dupin say n2care have quickly evolve from a company with an idea and no money into one that have lot of backing even before the prototype was reveal monday n2care and the medcottage have cause a lot of buzz during the past few month recent national attention have come from the washington post aarp and cbs the attention have spread globally and the business have field international inquiry dupin say after the post publish an article in may every little old lady in the world call we ask for one since dream up the concept dupin have assemble a team that include an engineer from virginia tech the ceo of a modular home manufacture company and several other with expertise in the hospice and home health care arenas n2care form in december 2008 and in august 2009 the privately hold limited liability company go public with the medcottage concept in april gov bob mcdonnell sign a bill into law

medcottage he is a member of n2care leadership team but he is also the president and ceo of cardinal homes inc a manufacturer of modular home in wylliesburg in charlotte county he form an affiliate of cardinal home mc manufacture inc for the sole purpose of manufacturing medcottage it was berneche relationship that secure the money need to build the prototype the charlotte county industrial development authority and the tobacco indemnification and community revitalization commission each contribute 50 000 to the development of the first medcottage the prototype is technically being lease by the ida to n2care for two year at no cost say susan conn director of operation for n2care charlotte county provide the financial backing because it have a strong working relationship with berneche and believe in the product say larry dunn a member of the ida board economically it just make sense to try and help the company that have help our county so much dunn say investor have start to financially support the effort currently n2care have about 20 investor say conn but she would not say how much money have been raise however conn say the company need about 3 million to support the startup the medcottage include feature such as a pressurized ventilation system similar to those find in hospital intensive care unit it also have a video system that monitor the floor at ankle level so a caregiver will know if a patient fall another system dispense medicine at the proper time and dosage it even alert a caregiver if the patient do not take the medicine out of the system the medcottage is still in its infancy with many improvement being plan dupin say next the prototype will be take to virginia tech where several project are being plan to study and possibly improve on the model say janis terpenny a tech system engineering professor and a member of the n2care team she is also jason mother frankly I think it could be configure to whatever the need are of the person

hello everyone I am new here and would like some insight of the symptom I have been experience for as long as I can remember after have a bowel movement I would wipe and there would be yellow on the toilet paper other day nothing I think it was normal so never give it a thought I have also always suffer from constipation since I was little I am now 19 year old I would sometimes find a small amount of blood on the toilet paper which I think was normal because I was constipate and it would hurt for it to come out result in a cut anyways so a few month ago I start suffer from major anxiety due to health scare first I think I was go to have a heart attack stroke then I think I have a brain tumor diabete and so on little symptom would trigger my anxiety and I would search the internet for hour try to diagnose myself until I get to a doctor I finally say enough is enough and stop google symptom then one day my butt was really itchy and when I wipe there was yellow on the toilet paper so I google it and become concerned with the result I was send into a panic and go to the doctor who send I to a gi specialist he run no test on I but say I have a constipation problem and well start by clean out my system he give I magnesium citrate after take this I do not have the yellow on the toilet paper after wipe then I get sick from the citrate so I stop take it so I go back to my normal life I still have bowel movement every 2 3 day that were like rabbit pellet but I was use to this I never ever drink water maybe 2 bottle a week at the most so this could be my constipation issue so a couple day ago I go to the bathroom small hard piece again and experience clear mucus with a streak of blood on the toilet paper I run back to google and diagnose myself with cancer that was the good match to my symptom everywhere I look I develop horrible health anxiety again and could not stop cry I take 2 biscadoyl tablet that is a laxative and have one small bm follow by yellow mucusy diarrhea the next morning the same thing happen and when I wipe there were small black fleck on the toilet paper I go into panic mode and call the gi doctor to schedule an appt which is for tomorrow since then I have take the laxative again only to produce yellow mucusy diarrhea and some red spot in the stool which I have put into a plastic bag to take with I to the doctor it look as if there is small black speck in as well as small red piece which I can not tell is blood or not I am terrified and pretty sure I have cancer at this point any input would be great thank you,negative,-1
hi I am new to the forum for the past couple of month I have been experience blood in my stool on off in the last bowel movement I have I see a bright red streaked mucus like jelly at the end of my movement at time the stool will sometimes coat with blood towards the end of movement mainly when the poop is big sorry for the graphic talk I also sometimes experience itchiness but randomly and I have chunk of red in my stool aswell I have no idea if these chunk are blood or food because they are like piece similar to chili flake mix in with the stool is this likely due to it being chunky piece or blood chunk if that is even possible always suffer from constipation and have been take psylium husk help I with regular soft stool I have not have any other symptom except mild blood streak I have also been suffer from reoccure ovarian cyst from 18 year old I am now 22 I can not take the pill due to vomit I guess that maybe the stool blood ovarian cyst is relate but I am skeptical because from what I have research m d doctor say no my cyst is currently 4 5 cm I am unsure of whether the blood have been there for long than notice a few month ago I see a specialist who have refer I to do a flexible sigmoidoscopy he say it sound like internal hemorrhoid and once you get they you need they treat otherwise the bleeding do not stop he say it is unlikely bowel cancer because of my age and because its rare which I know is not impossible I am really scared I have bowel cancer because I know some people diagnose only have blood and nothing else I know I should not be self diagnose but I am in a total emotional wreck thankyou and I hope I can get reassurance and guidance,negative,-1

this is long but if you have time please read it and give I your thought I am a 32 year old male pretty overweight 6 2 280 pound around 200 is my ideal weight been smoke around a pack a day since I was 13 or 14 until around age 25 I was normal weight but around that that time I quit a heavy drinking habit and start gain weight I suppose I substitute malt liquor for mcdonald without think about it when I was about 27 I start have heart palpitation go to a cardiologist and he say that I have a some slight regurgitation in my mitral valve that was not anything to worry about and that I should quit smoking he say the palpitation were nothing to worry about as well and were not life threaten for awhile the palpitation were quite disturbing but over time they go from one or two episode a day to a couple a month and they really do not scare I that much anymore however a couple time I have have a few extend episode where they keep come back to back for several hour and each time I go to the er last year in february was one of these extend episode at the er as they have do all 3 or 4 time I have end up there they basically assmue I am have a heart attack and do the basic blood test to check for heart attack and do chest x ray each time there was no evidence of heart attack and they say to lose weight and quit smoking which regretfully I still have not do I have cut back from a pack a day to 4 or 5 and lose 20 pound after I quit drinking soda and fast food but I still need to quit smoking entirely and seriously focus on lose weight anyway last summer I start have some irritiation in my throat ear and eventually in my chest basically feel like a minor cold that would never go away my throat is never really sore just scratchy and the upper part of my chest always feel raw like I have been jog in cold air I have insurance now which is not that great of insurance but it is well than nothing but it only recently go into effect back when all this start I was go to a local free clinic for medical care I go to the free clinic twice with no explanation really the first time they say allergy and the second gerd which I do not think is the problem I sould also mention that this irritation in my ear throat and upper chest is entirely on my right side the left side feel fine I also go to an ear nose and throat doctor and pay out of pocket with no explaniation either except to quit smoking well now that I have get insurance I make an appointment with a real non free clinic doctor I tell the doctor what was go on in my ear throat chest but instead of try to find out what the problem was he give I this holy than thou type attitude and lecture I for 15 minute about my weight and how I should quit smoking which I already know about he say to try some benadryl and that it is allergy I tell he that I already try an anti histimine but he just go back to my smoking and say he want a chest x ray they do the chest x ray and everything was normal except for about a per annum sized spot on the very low part of my right lung he say that it might be cancer great I go for answer and walk out with more problem he consult another doctor and the other doctor seem reluctant to on a ct scan but say to do it anyway both doc say it might be from a past fungal infection and might not be anything to worry about but want a ct anyway well after I leave thi office I go back to the hospital er where I have my last chest x ray back in feb of 08 they give I the image on a cd and I take they home and look at they I was curious if the spot was there in the old image it was not however the x ray from the hospital was much cleaerer and high quality look than the one from the doctor office the x ray machine in the doctor office today look like it was from the 70 and actually have part fall off of it maybe I am just try to convince myself that it is nothing but do you think that the spot they see today was just an anomoly on the film and not actually a spot is this possible give the fact that I have been a smoker for so long have this thing in the right side of my throat ear and chest for so many month I was already scared of cancer and now I am even more worried plus the spot was not there a year ago another thing that I am worried about is that my insurance only cover up to 10 000 dollar per year the doctor today say that the ct I will be have is only about 800 to 1200 dollar but I have a ct do in the er several year ago when I was have extreme unexplained abdominal pain and it was over 6 000 dollar likewise my wife go into the er with a bad bladder infection and they do a ct and she get a bill for almost 7 grand base on what I have read they will probably want to do another ct in 3 month to see if the nodule have grow if the first one is over 6 000 buck I just would not be able to have it do again until next year just pay the 20 percent on 10 000 is go to be hard enough I am really worried and concerned and any advice or anything you can share is greatly appreciate I know I need to quit smoking and am plan on quit this weekend as soon as I can afford some nicotine gum I quit for 4 month with nicorette a few year ago and it was not that bad so I know I can do it again I have to quit this time I also plan on continue to lose weight and put more effort into do it I guess I am just one of those people that think I will never happen

I know this sound like I am about to sell you something but I am not I am fulfil a promise I make to myself a while ago when I first make an appointment to have a full colonoscopy my history my uncle have die of colon cancer in 2001 while in his late 60 and my father succumb to lung cancer just last year 2004 at 71 my mother have a history of colon polyp and I mean so much that her examiner call she a polyp factory I have start to notice that my stool were diminish in diameter no blood no other symptom sometimes flatten sometimes pencil thin my diet is quite varied healthy and rich in fiber at 62 and 190lb I am in good physical shape I am 46 year old I was shock that when I go to my family doctor with my concern and she tell I to go straight for a full colonoscopy she do not recommend as I expect a first line fecal blood exam or sigmoidoscope she do not offer much in term of comfort on what else it could be but colon cancer give my family history I now have reason to be worried and I make my appointment immediately that was nearly a month ago I was depressed and search on the internet only depress I more if you do any sort of a search on thin or flat stool they point you straight to colon cancer the search term flat thin lead straight to calamity if you are read this you may have the same symptom and unless you are a complete have already decide to make an appointment to get yourself check out properly if you have make this decision then good for you you may also be scare out of your mind do not be if you have not make this decision then continue to worry and be uncertain so here what you probably want to know I just come back from my colonoscopy and I sail through it with fly colour it was fast do not require any sedation I would rate the discomfort equivalent to a short about of diarrhea there was a flash of pain as the doctor go for the last corner before the finish line however that last little sore spot was worth it because I get a full colonoscopy and a full proper view of everything next to I in the wiate area was a 52 year old guy who was come for a follow up exam three year after his cancer surgery judge by his slim healthy appearance I would say that he have a succesful surgery and judging by his tight jean I would guess that he do not have a colostomy bag he would have been 49 for his surgery three year old than I I do not know whether the surgery was to remove a benign polyp or a pre cancerous one or a malignancy so here what I have to tell you from my experience if you have reason to be concern act on it if your profile is somewhat like mine you probably have nothing dangerous but to ignore it is stupid onc again if you ve make the appointment relax if you have not make the appointment then continue to be scared and uncertain until you do make an appointment then you can relax in my case it turn out to be nothing I am fine chance are you are fine too stop being scared just take comfort that you are not do something stupid and dangerous like ignore a possible early warning sign by the way the night before my examination and as a tribute to my recently deceased dad who always want I to have a kid I decide to go to the foster parent plan web site url http www fosterparentsplan ca url and adopt a little girl in bangladesh I ask for the girl who have been on the waiting list the long adoption mean a continuous 30 40 month sponsorship donation for the child I would say that give the result today this little girl whoever she is is now my guardian angel in case you could use your own real live guardian angel you might want to try the same thing it seem to work for I good luck,negative,-1

hi all glad to have find this site and this support group my wife recently die july 26 2017 of bile duct cancer it was very quick and very overwhelming she was diagnose in mid june and I watch her die on july 26 to say the whole experience was shocking would be an understatement I myself am usually a fairly strong and independent person although this have test I severely I was totally alone with she through this ordeal her daughter are estranged from she and my family is not close her one daughter travel 7 hour just to be by my side in the last 2 day which I am totally grateful to she for do that after I get to the hospital which was for myself a 2 hour travel time she only last another 36 hour so it was not a draw out suffering and death like so many other cancer patient have the misfortune to endure this form of cancer is not common her mother and uncle die of liver cancer so it is familial in nature to some extent genetically pass on potentially word alone can not describe this life experience the research I have do describe the loss of one spouse as the most tragic and life change death one will encounter more than your mother father sister brother and so on this person fill so many facet of your life lover confidant advisor friend life partner travel companion and so on and so on I have read many other post on here from other people go thru the potential loss of a love one or from a loss that have already occur and you have my total sympathy empathy and support take thing slow and look after yourself and grieve on your own schedule not everyone feel the loss the same way if it help anyone out there I have always look upon life as a roadtrip a lot of the trip is great and smooth pavement we drive along without a care just seize the fresh air and scenery we encounter minor detour and rough pavement but continue on then we encounter a major fork in the road a detour beyond our wildest nightmare something that have the potential to not only damage our vehicle but test our mettle and if we are really unlucky we get into a terrible accident this is what it have feel like to I a major accident that I have encounter on the road of life unexpected and without warn however I have find we are not alone on this highway there are vast amount of other people that will not only help we recover but have actually go thru the same misfortune and can offer vast amount of advice and support to attempt to get we back on the road of life I find support forum like this are comprise of such people who come from all age group diverse experience and just need the opportunity to talk about such suffering I will surely be talk to anyone that can help I and will reciprocate any way I can for anyone else I think we just all need one another to help we get thru this try time,very negative,-2

hi everyone my mom was diagnose with stage 1 lung cancer about a year ago after do her chemo treatment once every 3 week we get some good news that the tumor shrink to almost non existant she is suppose to do 1 more session of chemo but she is been have other problem that have pospone her last treatment it have been about 2 month since her last treatment and for about the past week or so we have notice that she have have trouble hear she was admit to the hospital and we were notify this morning that she now have complete hearing loss now the doctor there have not say for sure that it is from the chemo they are still run test but they think most likely it is and so do I I m just wonder is the hearing loss always permanent what are the chance that she will get all or at least some of here hear back if there is some chance she will how long can it take I just hate to see this happen and I have a feeling if it is permanent that everything will just go down hill from here I know hear loss is a small price to pay for have life but I do not think that she will think that way and do hear loss usually take this long to kick in after chemo have start I just think that if there would be symptom that they would kick in after just couple treatment she do start lose her hair after the 2nd or 3rd treatment,negative,-1
I am sorry to reopen the topic of date a widower but I feel a real need to share my feeling about the way that christinem46 was handle when she come onto the site to ask for advice on how to support the widower that she was date please consider the following as a widower I wish that my friend and family have come onto this site to seek advice on how to support I and to understand what I was go through if a divorced friend of mine was date a widow and he want to know how to help she cope with her grief I would send he to this site to seek advice where other than ds is anyone go to find well advice on understand the need of a widow or widower if one of our member do eventually decide to date would that member not feel good about any man or woman who would be so thoughtful as to try to understand what we are go through when my wife was diagnose with brain cancer I go onto an online support group for brain cancer and I receive a lot of great advice from people with brain cancer and from those who were care for brain cancer I know other who care for their spouse who were die of lung cancer who have the same experience when you want advice on how to support someone with a particular disease or crisis where can you get batter advice than from those who are experience the crisis I have reply to at least 5 other similar discussion topic post by divorced or single people during the last year where I feel I was able to help they understand the feeling and need of a widow or widower just because the woman was date a widower do not make it any less important for she to want to seek advice as a matter of fact it explain why she would want to try so hard to support the widower if someone is offend that the widower she is date choose to date after only 9 month that is no reason to take it out on she for all we know she could have been one of many woman that the widower have date he certainly is open to date there have been widow and widower on this site who have date in less than 9 month and while many of we may think that is quick I can not imagine any of we pass judgment on another widow or widower if there is one thing that we all learn and accept it is that no one should judge we because we each have our different circumstance and feeling if we are not go to judge the widower she is date how can we judge she if someone come on and ask for advice on how to support their mother or friend who was a recent widow would we not offer advice just because the woman is date a widower do that make it any different I just want to encourage other member to be more supportive of non widow er who may come on this site in the future seek advice I think one member suggest that christinem46 start her own support group for people like she who are look for advice on support widow and widower I think that say it all there probably is no site like that and if there was I would hope that it would be comprise of the great member on this site because as I am sure you will all agree if you have not been there you do not know what you are talk about I hope this do not offend anyone tom,neutral,0

I do not think you need to concern yourself with getting rid of the virus since it is been prove impossible you can be healthy if you just learn to live in harmony with it countless virus are in our body from the book herb for hepatitis c and the liver by stephen buhner virologist have discover that when a balanced symbiotic virus is disturb it tend to jump specie in order to survive there are some 4000 mammal specie on the earth and 750 000 insect specie of the mammal specie 2000 are rodent and 1000 are bat that is 3 4 of the mammal in two family most virus that jump specie and infect people come from rodent bat and primate this is truly interesting there is a squirrel monkey in the amazon who live in peace with a herpe virus it do not bother the monkey although it live in the monkey even if the monkey immune system is artificially suppress the virus will cause it no harm this virus is in the fece and urine of this monkey so it is liberally sprinkle everywhere in their territory now if another compete monkey such as the mormoset try to invade squirrel monkey territory the virus jump immediately the marmoset monkey is infect and quickly develop lymph cancer and die for those who can not do tx or for whom tx is not an option or for those for whom tx have fail there is hope if we can see this virus as an ally not an enemy perhaps we can see a way to live with it in harmony when virus first enter a new specie they are very aggressive and try to kill off the one they have invade but that which do not kill we make we strong and virus are a part of our ecosystem perhaps we can delve deeply into the implication here and see that hcv is our ally if we can learn to live in harmony with it we will be strong for it and it can no long hurt we we can not kill off virus this have been know for a long time there is no cure for the common cold which is cause by a virus some people get cold all the time and other never do yet the virus is everywhere so what make the difference the immune system keep the immune system strong and virus can not destroy you,neutral,0

somewhat normally my first time around my second time around I was 100 a cancer patient at that point I go through six month of chemotherapy and that was a very different thing I lose all of my hair I look very sick I was on high dosage of the steroid prednisone which cause I to swell up and get what they call a moon face I lose all strength I was sick all the time so for that year I didna t go to school a diagnosis three in november of 1994 after almost three year of being cancer free the hodgkina s disease return for a third time both radiation and chemotherapy have fail and with few other option to explore doctor decide to do a bone marrow transplant the transplant involve a course of intense chemotherapy destroy nearly every cell of bone marrow before the stem cell could restart the system a at a certain point all of your blood count crash and then they just wipe out your immune system ita s like they throw you off a boat into the water you sit there and start to sink and then they throw you the life preserver thata s kind of how the treatment go and hopefully you are lucky enough to catch the life preserver I was lucky enough to catch the preserver and make it through the bone marrow transplant a diagnosis four more than two year remove from the bone marrow transplant kyle have graduate from college and was work as a sport writer at fox sport net when he was diagnose with a secondary leukemia on july 23 1997 the acute lymphocytic leukemia have been cause by the chemotherapy drug vp 16 which was give to kyle during the bone marrow transplant a I truly believe I have been hand my death sentence I was no long a rookie I have read a lot about it I know what kind of thing were happen to my body and I know what leukemia mean I also know that get leukemia from chemotherapy make it even bad and I know that because of my weak heart due to the chemo drug adriamycin they couldna t treat I as aggressively as they might have someone healthy I really think when the doctor tell I that I have leukemia that he was basically tell I that I was go to die a three long year of chemotherapy follow a most day were pretty long and I was pretty sick and there was a lot of pain involve so what I try to do was just focus on try to have a good half an hour every day then I could use that to get I to the next day that half hour could be a friend come by to talk baseball each morning when I would wake up I would try to figure out where I could find those thirty minute it was really about the people in my life I really enjoy my time with they and I wasna t ready to quit at that point I have think a lot about my own death and ia d come to the realization that I wasna t afraid of die but I was sure not ready to be do live a doctor come up with a course of chemotherapy that cure the leukemia without cause any further damage his already weaken heart after four bout with two different kind of blood cancer kyle was free of cancer but his heart condition was continue to deteriorate it eventually land he on a heart transplant list in 2001 more than five year later kyle get the call a donor heart have been find and was wait for he a the heart transplant was different because they were actually go to be restore I it was scary but there was also some excitement because I know eventually the cloud would lift and on the other side of the cloud I would find what could pass for normal life I would be get strong as each day pass a throughout his battle kyle recognize that a the meaning in our own life come from help other a he have since devote his life to serve other through his motivational speak his write his memoir a heart of irona come out this november and a commitment to the leukemia lymphoma society and their team in training program team in training help train nearly half a million runner walker triathlete cyclist and hiker who raise money to fund lifesave cancer research kyle begin train and compete in triathlon eleven month after his heart transplant kyle cross the finish line of his first race as a triathlete in the 2007 nautica malibu triathlon and is now train for a his everesta to be the first heart transplant recipient to complete the kona ironman in hawaii why a because I can because I shouldna t be able to because for so long I couldna t because there are so many I know who never will because the scar on my chest hip and shoulder tell my story they tell the story of my heart donor a a man who exit this world far too early but in death leave behind the most precious gift imaginable a kyle believe that the strength of the human spirit is what get we through the tough time a the nice thing about being down in the valley is that there is always a mountain on the other side of it you just have to get through that valley and once you do you can start to climb out again no sadness or pain or fear is permanent there is always something good around the corner there is a lot of beauty in life most of

hi there I am look for comment or response to the awareness or knowledge of the relationship between elevated iron iron overload also know as hereditary hemochromatosis and congestive heart failure or how many people have even hear of iron overload or hemochromatosis my husband 57 was recently diagnose with hhc after over 10 year of try to figure out what was wrong numerous drs numerous testing have many symptom that suggest heart problem like shortness of breath chest pain irregular heart beat heart palpitation profuse sweating and grey skin feeling of lack of oxygen heart test and lung function show everything quite normal the testing continue over the course of time 8 week ago our internist who is investigate liver damage and elevated liver enzyme tell we on a follow up that he have been find to have hemochromatosis it is the most common genetic disorder among people of european descent particularly irish scottish it is in fact also know as the celtic curse so my husband is irish how do we get to chf hhc is genetic and we come home from our appointment and look this all up have no prior knowledge of what this was and wow were we surprised iron load onto liver first cause diabetes and cirrhosis then it load equally as much onto the heart cause everything from heart palpitation to irregular heartbeat shortness of breath enlarge heart and lead to congestive heart failure which my husband dad die of several year ago no explanation no one know but have the genetic variation he obviously get this from his parent he carry two copy of the gene involve in iron overload and it cause heart damage and eventual organ failure my husband dad also have colon cancer and have part of colon remove but my husband grandfather also die of colon cancer colon cancer is a high rate among iron overload as are many other cancer cancer thrive in iron rich environment I come across this site daily strength in my search for answer and understanding and have meet many people over the last several week with story just like our on the hemochromatosis forum on this site also who explain and talk about their complication from iron overload with the heart problem the liver and digestive problem the neurological and thyroid damage joint pain and pituitary gland damage no one can imagine the toxic mess this make our body and unfortunately it is a silent killer slowly and quietly do damage until we are diagnose with diabetes or arthritis it load onto joint and cause arthiritis or heart failure chf or hypothyroidism or hypogonadism or infertility or fibromyalgia vision and skin manifestation with rash blister and eye disorder and vision loss like my husband or even miss and alzheimer leave we vulnerable to infection and virus like hepatitis and mono lead to all other type of infection or pancreatitis or gallbladder disease or ib or colitis believe I the list is endless and I can tell you the relationship between why a person have congestive heart failure even at a young age and in seemingly healthy individual is not a leap of faith it is real and it is insidious I would like to hear from people here what they think about all this I know we never know anything of it think it was all quite a part of life get heart problem and the diagnosis but the question is why why do we have these problem in the first place and why are drs miss this so often it is a simple blood test but not routine and yet it can tell we so much and is a tool for prevention of more serious disease later on it destroy the heart and I just want to pass this along to all the folk here in heart failure forum just as a thought for the day something to read something to investigate one never know as iron is remove from the body many of the symptom of heart trouble can disappear and resolve at least prevent further damage I think that is worth the trouble of find out if this is something that could have cause the damage to begin with take care everyone and good wish,neutral,0

so I meet with dr ditreich sp at mt sinai and I have some infor to share 1 tt cc and so on it never make sense to I that someone who do not survive a killer flu would be around to have descendant but he explain that the c come from survive a particular virus and they do not know which one it was there is a similar gene for hiv that one is relate to beubonic plague he say the tt cc will still matter for the new tx but not as much as with inteferon 2 the combo that everyone want from the two different drug company he say he have someone in his office who s good at fight with insurance cos and may be able to get it for his pt if not and we were to get one drug cover and buy the other out of pocket it would be 35 000 that let I out 3 he also say some large study show that people with hcv have twice the likelihood of die than people without even if they have no liver disease he explain that the chronic inflammation lead to other disease this make more sense to I than try to understand how a virus cause cancer or heart disease 4 he also push getting vaccinate for hep a and b say I would have a 40 chance of die if I contract one of they now my personal stuff he gain point with I by not ask how I get it but lose point for dismiss my concern about riba he actually say that drug is nothing he also lose point for respond to my concern about long term side of the new txs by say that most drug that are dandangerous do not make it to approval I rea d somewhere else that 50 of all approve drug are later recall that may not be true but I know there are a decent number overall I like he and my good news is that my fibroscan was 6 9 stage 1 very different from my fibrosure and supposedly the fibroscan is more accurate than a needle biopsy because it cover a large section of the liver so I can wait for well tx well I was wait but I was feel unsure about it now I can wait and relax,neutral,0
hi I am ask this question for my neighbor I do not know the answer and do not want to guess she have a colonoscopy schedule for may 11 it was schedule yesterday base on her symptom it was the soon she could get with the doctor she want if she go elsewhere she can get soon she is debate her primary care schedule this and was sketchy on answer to question tell she to relax and just get an answer from the test of course she would like to know if anyone have an idea from their experience her stat 51 year old occasionally constipate not often and when she is it is very medication relate she take about 8 to 12 percocet a week due to a foot injury I am tell you this for grin and giggle her husband run over her foot with their sleep 8 pop up camper last summer yep no one in her immediate family have have colon cancer parent sibling aunt uncle cousin her question about 1 5 month ago she have a week where she frequently feel like she still have to have a bowel movement after have one pretty much daily about 3 4 of the time she actually have to go more and would in about 20 minute in other word most of the time when she have the feeling of need to go more she actually need to go more then it stop for several week and start again last week so with that she go to her doctor and got schedule her main question is if this is a symptom of a problem would it come and go and when they say that feeling like you have to have a bowel movement is a symptom of problem do they mean it is a symptom if you then can not go or when then try to go there are other issue like bleed pain constipation secondly with this being the only issue she is have would you recommend she go to another doctor to get a soon test thank for any thought understand you are not a group of doctor but think you might have have this experience,neutral,0

I when into the web site and look up my illness and though it talk about have cancer I do not have cancer but I still get the symptome that go along with it but because there is still a gland leave that they can not find because it is as small as the end of a safty pin and they can not find it but they teast I yearly for cancer because they are scared that some doy it could turn into cancer as lond as that parathyroid gland is leave in side of I I am send you the information that I find so if you want to read it you will beable to understand what I am try to fight through and pray thay I have the streangh to get through this sorry that it is so long but there is just so much information on how this illness is affect my health hypercalcemiaoverview an increase level of calcium in the bloodstream is most often a complication of cancer and is refer to as hypercalcemia of malignancy in its severe form hypercalcemia may be a life threaten emergency management of hypercalcemia may involve increase fluid intake as well as the use of diuretic and bisphosphonate drug what is hypercalcemia what cause hypercalcemia what are the sign and symptom of hypercalcemia how is hypercalcemia diagnose how is hypercalcemia treat what is hypercalcemia hypercalcemia is an increase level of calcium in the bloodstream this disorder is most commonly cause by malignancy call hypercalcemia of malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism other cause of elevated calcium are less common and are usually not consider until it have been determine that neither malignancy nor parathyroid disease is present hypercalcemia of malignancy occur in approximately 10 of patient with advanced cancer the occurrence of hypercalcemia may rise as high as 40 in some type of cancer include breast lung and multiple myeloma what cause hypercalcemia hypercalcemia of malignancy have many cause it may be relate to the spread of cancer from its site of origin to bone in the body a process call metastasis cancer cell can spread or metastasize through the blood and lymph system a cancer cell may break away from the original location in the body and travel in the circulatory system until it gets lodge in a small capillary network in bone tissue cancer may also spread to bone from the adjacent cancer though this occur less frequently than spread by the blood stream bone metastasis result in injury to the bone tissue although bone appear to be the most static of all the tissue in the body it is actually very dynamic and active normal bone is constantly being remodel or break down and rebuild every week human recycle 5 to 7 of their bone mass as much as half a gram of calcium may enter or leave the adult skeleton each day one important function of bone remodeling is maintenance of blood calcium level calcium is necessary for many process in the body include contraction of muscle nerve function blood clotting and cell division only 1 of the calcium in the body is available in circulation for these function the other 99 is lock in the bone if blood calcium level drop calcium must be release from the bone through remodel in order to maintain important physiological function that require calcium in the case of hypercalcemia bone metastasis cause an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption result in the release of excess calcium into the blood what are the sign and symptom of hypercalcemia sign and symptom of hypercalcemia may include nausea fatigue vomit lethargy stomach pain moodiness constipation irritability anorexia confusion excessive thirst extreme muscle weakness dry mouth or throat irregular heart beat frequent urination coma these many sign and symptom are commonly attribute to either the cancer treatment or the malignancy itself and may make it difficult for doctor to detect hypercalcemia of malignancy when it first occur this disorder can be severe and difficult to manage severe hypercalcemia is a medical emergency require immediate treatment how is hypercalcemia diagnose hypercalcemia may be diagnose with a blood test blood calcium level are test by take a small amount of blood from the patient with a needle the blood is collect in tube and send to a lab for evaluation normal blood calcium range from 8 5 to 10 5 milligram per decliliter mg dl of blood the normal range may vary slightly from lab to lab more than one test may be necessary to determine that blood calcium level are abnormally high in a person with cancer a high blood calcium level is consider a medical emergency and treatment should be start immediately how is hypercalcemia treat the good treatment for hypercalcemia due to cancer is treatment of the cancer itself however since hypercalcemia often occur in patient whose cancer is advanced or have not respond to treatment management of hypercalcemia is sometimes necessary treatment for hypercalcemia is base on a number of factor include the condition of the patient and the severity of the hypercalcemia increase fluid intake and the use of diuretic have been standard practice most recently bisphosphonate drug have become an effective approach hydration one of the primary treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy is hydration which may consist of increase oral fluid intake or intravenous through a vein administration of fluid hydration help decrease the calcium level through dilution and cause the body to eliminate excess calcium through the urine for mild to moderate elevation of calcium patient are usually direct to increase oral fluid intake for acute hypercalcemia hydration with saline is immediately administer intravenously the rate of hydration is base upon the severity of the hypercalcemia the severity of dehydration and the ability of the patient to tolerate rehydration diuretic sometimes hypercalcemia of malignancy is treat with a diuretic the most commonly use diuretic furosemide lasixa a cause the kidney to produce more urine as a result the amount of free water in the body is reduce along with an increase in urine volume furosemide cause loss of calcium sodium and potassium furosemide is well tolerate however it is not free of side effect which may include dehydration low blood potassium and low blood sodium furosemide is available by intravenous administration as well as oral tablet intravenous method of administration is use to achieve an urgent effect oral tablet are use for maintenance oral tablet of furosemide are administer once or twice a day bisphosphonate drug recently bisphosphonate have become effective treatment for prevent the complication of bone metastasis include fracture relieve bone pain and hypercalcemia the goal of treatment for bone metastasis is palliative to relieve pain and risk of fracture and have historically consist of surgery radiation therapy and pain medication bisphosphonate drug a new approach to treatment for bone metastasis can effectively prevent loss of bone that occur from metastatic lesion reduce the risk of fracture and decrease pain bisphosphonate drug inhibit bone resorption or break down bone is constantly being a remodeleda by two type of cell osteoclast which break down bone and osteoblast which rebuild bone although the exact process by which bisphosphonate work is not completely understand it is think that bisphosphonate inhibit osteoclast and induce apoptosis cell death in these cell there is also evidence that these drug bind to bone thereby block osteoclastic resorption cancer cell release various factor that stimulate osteoclastic activity cause increased breakdown of bone by inhibit osteoclast bisphosphonate drug effectively reduce the detrimental impact that cancer cell have on bone density clinical trial have demonstrate the activity of two new bisphosphonate drug in cancer patient zoledronic acid zometaa a and pamidronate arediaa a bisphosphonate effectively prevent or delay bone destruction and related pain this activity have been demonstrate in clinical trial with multiple myeloma 1 and breast cancer 2 patient when compare treatment with chemotherapy plus pamidronate to chemotherapy alone patient receive pamidronate were less likely to experience complication relate to cancerous involvement of the bone such as fracture additionally patient receive pamidronate live long have a less need for radiation and surgical treatment and experience significantly less pain than those patient not receive the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid demonstrate the strong activity of these two bisphosphonate drug in a recent clinical trial zoledronic acid was show to be a safe and effective treatment in prostate cancer patient with bone metastasis compare to placebo zoledronic acid significantly reduce the proportion of patient who experience skeletal complication extend the time to first skeletal complication and significantly reduce the risk of skeletal complication over the course of this 15 month study 3 these result are notable because they show activity of zoledronic acid in blastic lesion in which extra bone have build up whereas previous trial have only show activity of bisphosphonate on metastasis in which the bone is weaken both zoledronic acid and pamidronate are administer intravenously but zoledronic acid provide a more convenient regiman for patient zoledronic acid is administer in a dose ten time low than pamidronate result in an infusion time that is significantly short 15 minute versus 2 4 hour for pamidronate in an effort to eliminate the need for intravenous administration research is aim at

common life threaten disorder that is associate with cancer it occur in 10 to 20 of cancer patient lung cancer breast cancer and multiple myeloma are the most prevalent malignancy associate with hypercalcemia the cause of hypercalcemia is when cancer spread to or invade the bone and when malignant cell release certain factor that cause calcium to be release from the bone this cause bone to break down fast than they are being rebuild result in an increase calcium release into the blood stream normally your kidney would eliminate excess calcium from your blood but with hypercalcemia the kidney can not keep up with the elimination process some physical sign to look out for when your blood calcium is too high would be tiredness confusion unstable gait constipation decrease appetite increase urination and bone pain if hypercalcemia is not diagnose it can lead to more serious complication like heart problem convulsion and even coma if you feel any of these symptom or if your

severe hypercalcemia correct total serum calcium 12 mg dl your doctor may prescribe some drug biphosphonate to stabilize the bone and prevent hypercalcemia pamidronate arediaa a and zolendronic acid zometaa a are the preferred drug for treat hypercalcemia and maintain blood calcium level these drug do not decrease calcium rapidly so other measure may be need to reduce calcium more quickly this may mean that you may have to be admit to a hospital for monitoring and drug therapy this therapy include a lot of intravenous fluid usually a saline solution along with a diuretic like furosemide lasixa a the diuretic should not be start however until you have been properly hydrate with the saline solution pamidronate or zolendronic acid may be use concurrently and then every month if need sometimes a drug call calcitonin is use to help low calcium until the biphosphonate start work around 2 to 4 day these drug are not available in oral form so they must be give intravenously other medication that are use to treat hypercalcemia are etidronate clodronate plicamycin and gallium nitrate however they are not as effective they have more side effect and they are not tolerate very well

is a virus the cause of fatigue syndrome science time d1 the new york times october 13 2009 could a virus be the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome a study publish last week in the journal science suggest that might be the case report that many patient who have the syndrome were infect with a recently discover virus chronic fatigue syndrome have long been a medical mystery and the subject of debate sometimes bitter among doctor researcher and patient it affect at least one million americans cause extreme fatigue muscle and joint pain sleep problem difficulty concentrate and other symptom its cause is unknown symptom can last for year and there is no effective treatment researcher disagree about whether it is one disease or a collection of symptom that may have different cause in different patient it have sometimes been stigmatize as more mental than physical with patient label neurotic depressed or hypochondriacal many patient find even the name of the disorder offensive a not so subtle hint that it is not a real disease the new report have intrigue scientist been see as vindication by some patient and inspire hope for a treatment I just feel like the whole future have change for we say anne ursu 36 a writer live in cleveland who have have the syndrome in the past but the new study is not conclusive and a great deal of work remain to be do to find out whether the new virus really do play a role just detect it in patient do not prove it is what make they sick people with the syndrome may have some other underlying problem that make they susceptible to the virus which could be just a passenger in their cell even so thousand of patient have already contact scientist ask to be test say dr judy mikovits the first author of the study and the research director at the whittemore peterson institute in reno a research center create by the parent of a woman who have the syndrome dr mikovits say she expect a test to become available within week the new suspect is a xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus or xmrv which probably descend from a group of virus that cause cancer in mouse how or when xmrv find its way into human is unknown but it have also been link to cancer in people it was first identify three year ago in prostate cancer and later detect in about one quarter of biopsy from man with that disease and in only 6 percent of benign biopsy it is a retrovirus from the same notorious family that cause aid and leukemia in people dr mikovit and researcher from the national cancer institute and the cleveland clinic report in science that 68 of 101 patient with chronic fatigue syndrome or 67 percent were infect with xmrv compare with only 3 7 percent of 218 healthy control subject further testing after the paper was write find the virus in nearly 98 percent of about 300 patient with the syndrome dr mikovits say she say she believe that the virus would eventually be find in every patient with chronic fatigue syndrome xmrv affect the immune system can probably cause a variety of illness and may join force with other virus to bring on the syndrome she say the study receive a mixed review from dr william c reeve who direct public health research on the syndrome at the center for disease control and prevention he call the research exciting but preliminary and say he was surprised that a prestigious journal like science have publish it because the researcher do not state the age or sex of the patient and control or describe the duration of the illness or how it come on if I do not know the nature of the case and control I can not interpret the finding dr reeve say we and other are look at our own specimen and try to confirm it he say add if we validate it great my expectation is that we will not he note that there have been false start before include a study in the 1990 link the syndrome to another retrovirus which could not be confirm by later research many patient and a community of doctor and researcher who specialize in the syndrome take issue with the disease center approach to the illness and the way it define who is affect they claim that the c d c include people whose problem are purely psychiatric muddy the water and confound effort to find a physical cause frustration with the lack of answer lead annette and harvey whittemore whose 31 year old daughter have have the syndrome for 20 year to spend several million dollar to set up a research institute at the university of nevada in reno in 2004 and to hire dr mikovit to direct it mrs whittemore say she have long believe that the syndrome was an infectious disease but that scientist have reject the idea she finally decide she say if there was a place of our own where we could find the answer we could do it more quickly dr william schaffner an infectious disease expert at vanderbilt university say that the notion of a linger viral infection was plausible he say that although some patient claim to have the syndrome seem more likely to have a psychological problem other seem to have a physical illness there is a group who are young healthy active and engage and all of a sudden they are lay low by something dr schaffner say everyone tell the physician these are people who are functional and productive and this is totally out of character they are frustrated and often quite dishearten you feel that medical science have not catch up with their illness yet to determine whether xmrv is to blame more study are need say dr john coffin a professor of molecular biology and microbiology at tufts university it would help to find an animal model he say and to look at store blood sample to find out if there were people who become ill some set amount of time after contract the virus if antiviral drug make patient improve that will also help make the case against the virus he say the national cancer institute is take xmrv seriously say dr stuart le grice head of its center of excellence in hiv aids and cancer virology he say health official become especially concerned last spring when several research team look at prostate cancer report find xmrv in 3 percent to 4 percent of blood sample from healthy people in control group that could translate into 10 million american being infect with a newly discover poorly understand retrovirus that have already been link to two disease any virus at that level is obviously cause for concern dr le grice say add that it was important to find out if the virus was associate with any more disease and how closely he say that just carry the virus do not necessarily mean a person was at high risk for disease note that people may harbor other virus that will never harm they the immune system probably keep the virus in check but he ask if it is a problem how well can we diagnose it and how well can we treat it even though antiretroviral drug have already been develop to treat h i v infection he say this virus was different and might need its own line of drug he say more study were need to find out how common the virus is and how it is being transmit it is not know whether people can catch the disease from mouse or can infect one another retrovirus are often spread by blood and bodily fluid how significant a risk is this to blood bank dr le grice ask do we need to consider large scale screening in blood bank he say the institute would be work to develop reliable diagnostic test dr le grice emphasize that there is no evidence that the virus is spread through the population I do not want to scare anyone at the moment he say http www nytimes com

I am very sad to be here post this my mother turn 60 yesterday and have her colonoscopy this morning the doctor find a tumor that was too big to remove during the procedure he take a few sample and send it off for biopsy he tell we that just by look at it he is unable to tell we whether it is benign or malignant he say it is about 4 cm 1 5 inch and a fairly large size other than that he say we d have to wait a week for the result and whether they be malignant or benign the mass would need to be remove anyway of course I was cry my eye out and my mom was so calm but I just am so scared the doctor do not seem very optimistic at least in my opinion so her background she have have diverticuliti off and on in her 50 and suffer with constipation her whole life she have also have hemorrhoid but nothing too major she have never been a drinker or a smoker and cancer do not run in our family at all that we know of she is a just a tad overweight maybe 10 20 pound at most also she have never have a colonoscopy before she have no pain no weight loss and have a chest x ray about two month ago for an elective cosmetic procedure it was negative however she do tell I that she have have a tinge of bright red blood after a bm while wipe about three time in the past three year so this concern I a bit oh and about two year ago when she have severe pain in her left side she go to the er and they do a ct scan with iodine they discover that she have diverticulitis would they have see the tumor at this point so would mind help my mom and I out with these question we would appreciate it so much we would just like to know about the sizing and the real chance of this tumor being benign is there any way to find out the result early why can not he give we a well idea by just look at it I am so scared for my mom I can not even function she is my very good friend and I am a complete wreck I never think this could happen to she in a million year please give we any information and advice you have we thank you so so much oh and another question would a tumor be a large polyp or are these different finding in the rectum a nonobstructe large size fungate friable 4 cm by 4 cm mass was see the mass was not bleed,negative,-1

hello everyone I know ita s been awhile since I last post on my husband with nsclc I just want to focus on get through his treatment I slowly watch the chemo physically take the life out of he he look like the picture of death he was suppose to take 8 round of chemo and was tell to stop after round 6 the ct scan at that time show no change at all and that the tumor remain unchanged we were tell that you could have three type of result unchanged grow or shrink my husband opt to continue until the 8th round upon our doctor visit on may 2 my husband have tell the doctor that he have been cough up pinkish like stuff in his phlegm the doctor immediately tell he that he was not go to administer the avastin anymore he was suppose to stay on avastin even after the last treatment but any sign of blood in the phlegm could mean that he might be bleed internally he also indicate that the 8th round of chemo would not make any difference because accord to this late ct scan a row of black lymph node have appear along the lining of his pleural but everything else remain the same the doctor say for my husband to either start on the tarceva pill or he could take a month or two off to feel good we were tell that the side effect of the tarceva were rash and diarrhea we were also tell that because my husband was never a smoker that this would be the good choice for his 2nd line of treatment since the 1st line no long is responsive my husband thank the doctor very much for his quick action in get he start on his treatment out of respect for the doctor my husband also mention to he that he would seek a second opinion during his break possibly at md anderson and that he want the dr to know this our onc is a young dr and have a great bedside manner but we feel that he have take we as far as he could and that we need to try something a little different across the street md anderson is just a hop and a skip down the street of course the dr onc have his say about how you might be a test case or an experiment case and that everything that they have over at md anderson they have it there the onc also go as far to say that the only reason you would be look for a second opinion is if you are look for hope why do he think we are go through all this pain and suffering in the first place he also go as far to say we must all die someday it was as if to say it wouldna t do you any good to go over there because it will be a waste of time I was happy with the onc up until that point of the conversation I immediately call m d anderson the next day I have already do my research on 10 doctor that was accept by our blue cross hmo and they were all on the list we are fortunate that my husband was able to get approval for long term disability we just have to pay our own portion of the insurance to his work I speak to a lady there who was so nice and ask I a few question and get the process start right away she give I a list of 7 thing that they would need from his chart to get start and also warn I of possible trouble to get the referral from the pcps office I have my husband sign off on the release of medical record and before we leave the doctor office let they now we need they to expedite thing I hope that by monday we will have the necessary paperwork send to m d anderson I was tell that an appointment could be make 2 to 3 day after they receive everything we were very glad I just have to stay on top of thing to make sure that everyone do what they say they would do in reference to his medical record being send to we and md anderson my husband do even want people to see he anymore he is very subconscious about his look he was really down right before the result and I have to try to perk he up after get the result I convince he to tell his mom who will stay with we until he get well I tell my husband that it is not fair to keep carry this deep dark secrete around I was get tired of constantly lie to his family about his health and I was also get tired of listen to he put 20 different spin on what s go on with his health when he talk to other on the phone we have been carry this secrete now for 6 month I feel at least his mom deserve to know my husband is from a completely different culture and I know that his mom would talk to other family from back home this have cause a lot of chaos now his mom sort of know the truth she cry all night and this morning I take my husband out for a drive and his mom call most of his sister and brother there are 5 of they they start blow up my husband cell phone demand to know what s go on and why is mommy call they cry they even demand to speak with I want to know what is go on with my brothera s health as if to say that I am do something to he I am prepare for a weekend of hell and torture

hi all my husband was diagnose with stage 4 colon cancer we are very confused the initial ct scan of his lung and liver were negative but the surgeon find 2 small lesion on the liver during his surgery for the colon resection which were both biopsied and positive for cancer they do a follow up ct scan and pet scan which were both negative the lesion find in surgery do not even show up he is schedule to start 6 cycle chemo on tuesday the oncologist then say to track he will probably have to have laparoscopic surgery to view the lesion this sound a little strange the lymph node test after surgery were negative so of course we are hopefully wish this is all a mistake but I can not imagine they would get the biopsy wrong on both lesion our first thought is to get a 2nd opinion but we live in small town and this would take considerable time and delay treatment anybody ever hear of anything like this,neutral,0

hello all first time poster if thing go well hopefully last look for some info guidance on a worrisome finding here go 37 yr old male very physically active healthy diet moderate drinker all that good stuff however smoker vaper for about the past 20 year I smoke cigarette from 18 30 then transition to vape because like a lot of people at the time I think it would be a less harmful alternative when everybody start get sick from it this year I decide to see a doc and make sure I was all good I was not experience any specific symptom but he give I a chest x ray and take blood and urine sample nonetheless that was about a month ago the blood and urine sample show across the board good health however the chest x ray reveal what he describe as a small nodule on the middle left lung and he could not tell what it was so he order a ct scan I just have the ct scan today doc call back with a recommend follow up appointment to go over the result in a week as well as a recommend follow up ct scan in another 6 month I am try to interpret what all that could mean and the suspense is kill I I feel like the 6 month follow up ct scan might be encourage that make it sound like maybe monitor the thing is a good idea but arrange for immediate procedure is not yet necessary I am also choose to take my exceptionally good blood and urine result as an encouraging sign and for what it is worth the x ray tech also tell I I have huge lung which accord to he is for some reason apparently a good thing I have virtually none of the common symptom for lung cancer except that I have now been experience mild chest pain and discomfort in the exact area more or less that he tell I the nodule was discover and I am a bit concern this pain and discomfort could be a few thing first of all it start at the exact time I get the x ray result and I have a tendency toward mild hypochondria psychosomatic episode so it is entirely possible that upon hear potentially bad news my brain start make up symptom for a disease that is not there this chest pain discomfort is so mild it is also entirely possible that it was present before and I just never notice it until the doc give I incentive to start pay more attention a third possibility is that upon hear the result of the x ray I immediately give up vaping and have only cave in and smoke about 5 cigarette in the past month so perhaps I am just feel some side effect from not inhale garbage into my lung daily for the first time in 20 year a few other possibility could be that I am occasionally prone to heartburn gas problem and also as an active athletic type with an injury history I am somewhat prone to all sort of minor bodily ache and pain that I tend to usually ignore until give a reason not to ignore they or of course another possibility is that it is lung cancer I am just try to be realistic and consider all my option I have get a week of anxiety to deal with here while I wait for my follow up visit with my doctor to go over the ct result so here I am desperately hope for a reassuring opinion or two from a group of stranger familiar with this potential condition,negative,-1

hi I was just recently 2 mo ago dxd with a rare slow grow ovarian cancer they remove the entire tumor and believe they get everything but do not really look everywhere to make sure this type of tumor usually do not spread before surgery I complain of pressure pain in the upper left abdomen and across the top of my abdomen no one was concern nor do they examine I in the colon area I see 3 drs 1 gp and 2 specialist and a gyn resident prior to surgery after surgery I still complain about this discomfort and now have rectal bleed the rectal bleeding actually start in jan 2001 and my dr do the fobt negative and then tell I it was hemorroid no rectal exam am always constipate the bleeding was so minor just a touch of blood on the tissue maybe 4 5 time in a 1 1 2yrs mention again to dr in jan of this year again a fobt negative and now blood again a few week ago now with the pressure pain and the rectal bleeding and the recent ovarian cancer he believe I have colon cancer a separate cancer from the ovarian cancer what a blow was just tell I have an excellent prognosis from the ovarian cancer and now this I am only 33 yrs old I am still wait for the result of my barium enema I have last week and will be schedule for a colonoscopy although it have not been officially dxd there is not much else it could be I have pain pressure in the colon area accord to dr one localize area on the left side was a concern rectal bleeding bad for a few day after barium enema now one area on the upper right side is also very uncomfortable occasionally my stool shape is thin than normal I have always been slightly anemic due to my heavy period if I press my abdomen against a counter it also hurt the pain pressure is not there all the time but was still there after the barium enema I do not have diarrhea or watery stool or a sudden urgency to go so it can not be crohns or colitis ibs or diverticulitis I sure hope my dr is wrong but I can not think what else this could be it is really scary I think I was home free with the excellent prognosis on the ovarian cancer and now to be deal with this blow is just devastate my great fear is this is spread too far I am in canada where health care seem to take forever I am sure I would not be in surgery until late aug or sept maybe even long if drs are vacation what should I be ask my dr for for test and referral I know I should request a cea blood test and I am have a colonoscopy anything else I should be request thank please keep I in your thought,negative,-1

I recently lose my wife to brain cancer after help she to fight her battle for 9 month I miss she tremendously but I have a lot of good friend who support I for the last year and they have help a lot I could use some advice about the follow my wife and I were very close to 4 or 5 other couple who play golf go to the movie vacation together and in general we have a great time together one month before my wife die the husband of one of the other couple also die his wife and I are both feel awkward about our situation on one hand we have been able to talk to each other about our grief by phone and it have been very helpful we have been together with our friend on a couple occasion movie dinner but we are feel uneasy about meet alone e g for lunch because we are afraid our friend will think we are date or move ahead too quickly when we talk on the phone we are both able to cry and grieve about our spouse in a way that I can not do with any of my guy friend I suspect that we should minimize the occasion we do meet or even talk about our situation but I would appreciate any advice especially if anyone have been in a similar situation we are both around 60 and each of we have grow child and grandkid our family have know each other for year and I suspect that many of our friend and family are expect we to at least eventually see each other to perpetuate our long friendship both of we want to maintain our close tie to the other couple we have enjoy for year and we will probably be pull together from time to time as our friend invite we out as part of the group,negative,-1
my grandfather is 90 year old and he have been diagnose with stage 1 lung cancer on his left lung two week ago the doctor recommend radiation therapy but I read that surgery offer well overall survival and age shouldna t be the sole factor to determine the surgery suitability of the patient the doctor say the radiation therapy offer similar value to surgery but I guess I am being greedy by pursue a more aggressive option so my grandfather can live long he also have prostatic cancer which have been stagnant in growth for about 3 year now write all this I guess I want to be tell that a surgery is viable for a relatively healthy independent 90 year old my grandfather walk the dog and work out with small dumbbell every day rather than go for a less aggressive treatment option I am scared radiation will not do the good job in stop cancer I am scared surgery will meddle with my grandfather memory overall quality of life and bad case scenario he not wake up from general anaesthesia the doctor say if we want to go with surgery we have to wait until may 10 he just recover from covid and they say they need a rest period for his lung to recover to test his lung function and strength and ia m worried that lung cancer could spread more by then this have been a muddled read I am sorry for that but if anyone have been in a similar situation your advice would be greatly appreciate I know my grandfather is near the end of his life but he is still so active and I dona t want to lose he,negative,-1

period when hcv viral load in the blood is undetectable if this period of undetectability last for 12 consecutive week after the cessation of treatment it is call a sustained virological response write as svr12 this period usually then lead to a further 12 consecutive week of undetectable hcv for a total of 24 week of undetectability since treatment cessation write as svr24 historically a person is consider cure when they have achieve svr24 they are consider cure however many doctor who have have experience with test the new all oral regimen of anti hcv drug in clinical trial generally consider their patient cure if they have achieve svr12 svr link to long survival and other benefit lead specialist who study the liver and gastrointestinal tract have been conduct research to explore the many benefit of hcv treatment and cure svr24 they collect health relate information from participant with and without severe hcv related liver injury the 10 year survival rate of participant with an svr was not significantly different from the survival rate of hcv negative dutch people of the same age and gender over the same period of time thus even for people with severe liver injury get an svr can lead to broadly similar rate of survival as hcv negative people issue with emerge therapy for hcv in canada and other high income country most people can not afford to pay for the high cost of treat and manage catastrophic illness such as hiv hcv and cancer in response to this situation regional health authority have establish formularieslist of drug that are subsidize by the state until a drug is list on the formulary most patient can not get access to it the formulary negotiate with pharmaceutical company about the cost of their drug this back and forth between the formulary and company take time the cost of the new hep c treatment will be high and it is not clear when they will be on every formulary formulary can also put restriction on who can get their list medicine

relatively well to the new and powerful anti hcv drug such as holkira pak and harvoni past experience with boceprevir and telaprevir suggest that strain of genotype 1a are hard to treat we now focus on clinical trial result from participant with genotype 1a who were treat with holkira pak with and without ribavirin these result particularly among participant who receive ribavirin are very promising holkira pak result in genotype 1a with severe liver injury abbvie researcher analyse datum from participant with genotype 1a with severe liver injury who use holkira pak and ribavirin and find generally favourable result holkira pak effectiveness in people with kidney dysfunction people with chronic hepatitis c virus hcv infection can also develop kidney injury and dysfunction historically people with hcv who also have kidney dysfunction have not respond well to combination therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin prior to testing holkira pak in hcv positive people with

my boyfriend was diagnose with aml on january 3rd 2017 so we are new to this community for those of you who have time to read this I am go to try my good to describe our experience thus far and hopefully someone will have some advice to give I if you have any question please feel free to ask as there is a lot of information we have obtain in a short period of time and it is easy for I to miss something a little back round greg and I have been together for 7 month and we have a bit of an age gap between the two of we I just have my 22nd birthday on the 16th of december and he just have his 35th birthday the 30th of december we were both bear and raise in alaska and the both of we have never been married nor have kid often in alaska people form a type of seasonal depression in the wintertime because of the lack of sunshine and constant darkness mid november is kind of when greg start act weird in the sense that he was pretty tired most of the time and keep talk about how hard it was to get up the stair and little thing like that as athletic and active as he is I have assumption that he was develop a seasonal depression at the time he have no health insurance and as most man are do not want to see a doctor anyways as time go on his tan complexion become very pale and he develop serious lack of appetite and energy I was so confused and concerned by his behavior and tell he he need to either apply for health insurance or go to the er without insurance I think he must have some sort of anemia with the way he bruise so easily and that maybe he was depressed as well it was not only concern but it was affect our relationship I remember a couple day before christmas greg and I were lay in bed and he just flat out tell I that he know he have leukemia base on what he have read of the internet we both cry together that night especially I because the thought that my boyfriend might have cancer never even cross my mind it have hit I hard after I have read the symptom of leukemia but the possibility was so scary I just shrug it off it wasn t until the 3rd of january when he have hardly been out of bed for 3 day except to go to the bathroom and shower that I give he the ultimatum and say that he was either go to the hospital or I was go to leave he it seem like he was die before my own eye and I was not go to watch he suffer any more diagnosis it take a little less than an hour from the time we get to the er to diagnose he with leukemia fear run through I know that greg do not have any health insurance and I know this was far more than just get help for depression or anemia the news was a shock and emotion were high alaska do treat leukemia patient but I suppose that his count alarm the doctor enough that they feel as if he need to be medevac d as soon as possible to the university of washington medical center the problem was that he have a hemoglobin the amount of oxygen in his blood of 3 where as you and I have a hemoglobin of 15 16 in order for any person to fly they at least need hemoglobin of 7 so 4 blood infusion later he was at hemoglobin of 7 and we were fly out in a leer jet around 6 am on january the 4th by some miracle greg have apply for medicaid about mid december and we have not hear from they since so he and I both assume that he was still uninsured before we leave the er a lady pop her head into our room and say something as simple as alaska medicaid is go to take care of you do not worry about anything I remember my jaw drop and this huge weight was lift of our chest duration in the hospital we arrive at the uw medical center early in the morning on january 4th our room was beautiful with a great view of a harbor and mt rainier greg was so full of energy and he finally have color in his skin again think back I was so naive yes people become pale in the winter in alaska but I should have been more alarmed when he look almost transparent and his lip were kind of a yellowish color those 4 blood bag have give he so much life our attend doctor dr pamela becker so I am tell and truly believe it is the good in the country and we are fortunate enough to have she my understanding is that the typical way that they diagnose the type of leukemia a patient have is a bone marrow biopsy but because his blood was 60 leukemia cell it mean his bone marrow was at least 60 90 leukemia cell so they do not see the need for a bone marrow biopsy as they want to start chemo as soon as possible another thing you guy should know is that on january 1st twenty one year ago greg mom pass away after a little over a year fight with all leukemia before dr becker know the type of leukemia he have they really want to look into see if his leukemia was genetic when it come back as an aml diagnosis they wipe that possibility off the table they begin his g clam chemo regiman on the 7th of january which is administer daily for 5 day the first day of chemo he have so much energy that he walk 4 mile around the oncology floor which we learn about 2 day later was a huge mistake he have do such little activity the past couple month that his calf s have become so sore and stiff from the 4 mile walk that he literally could not walk his body could not heal he like a normal healthy person body would and it very much affect he with his symptom to come from the chemo the following night he was unable to control his bowel and I was not strong enough to be able to carry he to the restroom the first night this was happen was probably the first time in a long time that we have actually have an uncontrollable laugh I remember we were in the middle of a conversation and he sneeze and look at I in shock say hannah I just shit myself the bad part was that he couldn t lift himself up because of the condition of his calf s so the scene was a messy one it was a little early in life than I expect but here I was change my boyfriend s diaper which we still get a good laugh at at the same time he was run a high fever get up to 104 7 at it is high for about 4 day and have sever rigger which make his body even more sore by the 5th or 6th day he was still unable to walk but we have kind of get the diarrhea under control and we finally get some help from a physical therapist to help he get the strength to walk again on top of everything else greg is naturally a thin guy normally weigh 160 165lb at a height of 61 he weigh about 145lbs when he was admit into the hospital and if I think it was hard to get food down his throat before diagnosis chemo and fever cause by the chemo definitely do not help the situation when he was finally stabilize enough to be discharge from the hospital two week from the time we were admit he weigh 137lbs this time in the hospital all seem like a blur I was frustrate with myself because I was suppose to be the person to support he and be strong for he and I often find myself in the bathroom or hallway sobbing of course now I realize that those feeling are all very natural and for those of you read this that are the front line for your love one and feel the same way that this is all okay and we need to let ourselves feel that way now he now is an outpatient at the seattle cancer care alliance and go there every other day when he first become an outpatient we were tell that his disease itself is categorize as trisomy 6 we do his bone marrow biopsy on the 8th of february and the result come back that he still have 12 leukemia cell in his bone marrow and 0 in his blood I have hope he would be in remission so this was not the good news however the doctor reassure we that this is normal for a person who have such a high volume when he was first admit so on the 15th we start his second round of his g clam regimen he say he honestly have not feel this good in over a year and the chemo have yet to affect this I hope that since the chemo do not have as much to kill off this round that he doesn t have such a hard time with all of this like he do last time he also have gain weight since he was last in the hospital and now weigh 150lbs and look so much well than he have this past couple month his face is full and bright and is just very happy for someone with an aggressive cancer greg is an only child so they are currently look for a bone marrow donor for he right now we have 3 scenario as to what is go to happen next scenario 1 greg go into remission after this treatment and if they have a donor match then he will go straight to transplant scenario 2 greg go into remission but they have not find a donor match for he if that happen they will send we back to alaska to receive chemo treatment to keep he in remission until they find he a donor then we will go back to seattle and he will receive his transplant scenario 3 greg do not go into remission and we continue to attack the cancer with chemo treatment in seattle until he do go into remission and can get he into transplant we will not find out any of this for another 4 week when they can get a bone marrow biopsy and see where he is if he is able to go into transplant he will do the prep for transplant which I am completely unsure what this really consist of the 20 30 day prior to transplant and then when he receive his stem cell transplant he stay in transplant housing for another 100 day,neutral,0

alcoholism is a disease of the body thinking emotion and spirit progressive damage to these four aspect interact in various way such that a person is increasingly compel to drink also once drink start they can not always guarantee when they will stop or how much they will drink the body a genetic predisposition fifty percent of alcoholic have an inherit genetic makeup that almost guarantee they would become alcoholic when they begin to drink heavily for example the brain chemistry of some child or grandchild of alcoholic actually encourage heavy drinking alcohol metabolism alcohol is metabolize differently by some people as a result the body and brain require more alcohol to have the same effect than normal drinker would need cell alteration all heavy drinker undergo change at the cellular level of the brain where the brain cell meet extra receptor position grow to receive the heavy dose of alcohol relate chemical messenger when not drink these extra receptor position demand to be fill thus create a craving for alcohol brain damage alcohol in any quantity is poisonous to brain cell and kill off cell in their million the most critically affect part of the brain are those that deal with short term memory decision making and rational thinking woman heavy drinker develop brain damage with less drinking than man liver damage the most common liver disease of alcoholic is cirrhosis scar of the liver this disease result in reduce and corrupt chemical being send to the body which can result in damage to other organ woman suffer liver damage with less alcohol consumption than man alcoholic hepatitis ah ah is cause by other liver disease most notably cirrhosis of the liver more than 60 of person who develop both ah and cirrhosis will die within four year ah can cause change in sleep pattern mood and personality psychiatric condition such as anxiety and depression shorten attention span and problem with coordination may occur brain chemical the body and especially the brain rely on the liver to filter important body fluid and excrete waste as a result of contaminated chemistry from a damage liver the brain do not function properly typically a person will have cloudy and slow think heart damage heavy drinking cause damage to the heart muscle the heart pump less blood and an abnormal heart beat may develop woman suffer heart damage with less alcohol consume than man skeletal muscle heavy drinking cause muscle in the arm and leg to shrink for example an alcoholic may have leg that are out of proportion skinny than the rest of their body sufferer may become embarrassed about their body shape cancer the risk of cancer increase with great alcohol consumption more so in woman cancer can develop in the upper airway the liver breast and the bowel sexual organ and sexuality heavy alcohol use shrink the testicle in man and woman the breast grow large man produce more female hormone and woman produce more male hormone man become less virile and woman become less feminine as a result a person sexuality and libido is alter they may sense change in their sexuality and over compensate by become more sexually active indiscriminate or intoxicated sexual activity raise the risk of get sexually transmit disease think as detail before various damaged body organ and altered chemistry affect how the brain think this buildup of think change occur over an extended time period these small change are usually unseen by the sufferer the person react by adjust their reasoning and behavior to accommodate their new way of think alcoholic always adjust their thinking in way that are harmful to themselves and far they can not see the impact of their new cope style typically they begin to adopt a siege mentality inner self feedback and from other people indicate they are not quite at one with their inner self or the person they once were their experience seem to paint a picture to the sufferer that people around they are against they or are well than they or are just different from themselves they become insecure angry ashamed depressed and anxious about their altered attitude and action this siege mentality generate a self center perspective to protect their self concept they become taker and non giver I want what I want and I want it now sort of thing I need a drink now regardless of the need of other and when they do not get it they assert themselves even more become more demanding as the disease progress alcoholic will increasingly try to cope by drink more alcohol to take away the pain of their perception of being isolate in thinking and behavior they slowly adopt a denial attitude to their real condition which they eventually believe is reality for they the alcoholic drink more due to a different brain chemistry and metabolism have crave for more alcohol due to cell alteration and organ damage and drink more to cope with the effect of their change thinking and behavior they are drink to feel normal the emotion from the above it can easily be see that their emotion become strained and twist they become emotionally dependent on achieve and keep a state of denial of their true situation they deny it to themselves and other if their alcoholism is in threat of being expose or their alcohol supply is threaten they may protect themselves with anger bluff self pity manipulation depression run away and so on they feel as if they must continue their current emotional and think stance at all cost alcohol have become their good friend and they are loyal to it the spirit the spirit of a person is the center of their personality if as see above the person is not think feeling or act as their true self would not align with their spiritual self they are spiritually ill at ease or this ease a solution the progression of the disease must be arrest by stop drinking and restoration of health in all four area body thinking emotion and spirit it is the this ease spiritual state that is target by the most successful treatment service world wide alcoholic anonymous aa through the twelve step of recovery each person find their inner spiritual self by strip away the effect of alcoholism and

hello everyone I sign up as a member here a few month ago but never really post I always have been more of a reader than writer pretty much any question or concern I ever have I could find info for and I have get so much help just read but I have come to a point that I sure could use a little more personal encouragement understanding and lot and lot of prayer here is a brief I hope summary of my past 10 month I was diagnose with aml august 4 2015 I was 65 at the time now 66 my health record show diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with presence of erythroid hyperplasia 25 blast of all non erythroid cell normal female karyotype aml fish panel is negative molecular test show positive cebpa negative npm1 and flt3 I was tell that I fall into the intermediate range some good marker and some not so good I receive the 7 3 protocol of cytarabine and idarubicin for induction and except for body rash from allergy to one of the med and mouth and throat problem I do very well do not really feel sick and never vomitte I was only in the hospital for 17 day because I do so well my blood count bounce back within 3 week then I go back to the hospital for 5 day to start the first cycle of consolidation I have a total of 4 consolidation which end 1 11 2016 and I handle they with no real problem to speak of thank god a possible bmt sct was mention by my doctor pretty early on she want I to go to scca seattle cancer care alliance for a consultation but at that time I decline and tell she I do not want a transplant just chemo only pray all the time that I would not relapse even though I have been feel so great these past month and all throughout my treatment with just being a little tired between chemos when my count go down and feel so positive strong well than I have feel in year even year before diagnosis ready to climb a mountain this summer when we go camp I recently get the news that I relapse they find a few blast in my peripheral blood and after a biopsy they find 1 to 2 blast in my bone marrow I know could still be consider remission if under 5 but the doctor say no doubt of relapse and they go by last chemo for count remission in january so that just make I in remission for 3 month which is not good for salvage chemo alone so I finally agree to go to scca for a consultation and here are my 3 choice 1 I can do nothing more and have approximately 1 year nobody but god really know 2 I can do salvage chemo only which they give I a 15 chance of long remission 3 I can do chemo tbi and a transplant lot of protocol to choose from here give I a 35 to 40 chance of long remission I have almost decide on transplant the tbi and gvhd and all the risk are weigh heavily on my mind I have such good quality of life at this point I sure hate to loose it possibly for good in a way I would like to just try the salvage chemo alone have it do at the seattle cancer center since they have access to the late and great drug that are still in the process of being approve by the fda but they are able to use they and they are have very good success with I could be one of the 15 to make it to long remission but if I do that my chance go down if I relapse again and I am not sure a transplant would be in the picture then if I was much young I would go straight to transplant but at my age I really do not know what s good for I I know none of you can tell I what to do this is my choice alone I am just look for encouragement and prayer and whatever I decide in the near future to have a place to go where people understand what I am go through nobody can know unless they have been through it I know this is long and thank you to whoever read it it actually help to write it out I would welcome your thought good wish and prayer to everyone karen,positive,1

hello first of all I want you wish all of you a good health and a positive thinking secondly I am sorry for my english as it is not my first language I want to tell you my mother experience in lam m2 1 in april may 2013 she was diagnose with lam m2 and we have confirmation from other hospital abroad as well she have at that time 55 blast she start the first course of chemo in may 2013 7 3 regiman and also together with anti infectious prophylaxis at that time she have some adverse reaction after platelet allergic reaction bone marrow after the first course was 28 blast 2 second therapy june july 2013 the 7 3 regiman have been stop in day 6 follow by severe neutropenia and thrombocytopeinia for 28 day and mild cutaneous reaction to platelet 3 third chemo august 2013 7 3 regiman 7 day of well tollerance fast hemathological recovery 4 chemo 4 therapy with ara c 500 mg and doxorubicin 90 mg bone marrow evaluation 7 5 chemo 5 chemo well tolerate severe neutropenia for 7 day severe thromocytopenia for 10 day alergic shock after platelet transfusion this is one of the bad moment as my mother was near death at that time the doctor need to continue the transfusion but it was impossible at the same time because of the allergic shock in that moment she begin take afa algae complex formula one day later when the doctor check the platelet they conclude that the transfusion is not need anymore the value increase hour by hour day by day they could not explain why when I ask they an opinion on the afa algae and the increase of the vlaue they simply tell I that there is no link whatsoever right now she begin take ahhc as well briefly since then no more transfusion and the hematologyc level were fine some doctor tell I that without afa algae when would have been dead sorry for grammar 6 chemo 6 the doctor decide for a non aggressive regimen 2 5even if the doctor prepare blood product they do not need themthe combination was afa algae 6 pill per day ahcc 2 pill per day in january 2014 the bone marrow show 6 7 blast another chemo at that time and in feb as well as I remember 7 in march my mother tell the doctor that she need a pause of 30 40 day the bone marrow show around 4 blast the blood composition was fine conclusion since nov 2013 since she take afa and ahcc 1 fast recovery after chemo 1 2 day of neutropenia only 2 good and balanced healthright now my mother is in holiday with my father in the mountain she feel perfect she walk all day on the mountain she sleep well she check her blood and all the analysis say that all value are very good few week ago I ask her doctor about the afa algae and ahcc if there is any link between her good state since november and afa and ahcc finally he admit that in any case they contribute to the good health she have now moreover all the doctor discuss and they conclude that they need to prescribe to their patient unofficially ahcc and afa also since february my mother take resveratrol 200 mg as I read in many study the resveratrol is able to provoke the aptosis of the leukemia cell and the remake of the leukemia stem cell my comment after 1 year of reading 1 the chemo alone do not cure it only kill the blast and keep they at a low level this could be in many case a temporarily solution that s why many patience relapse as a metaphor let say we have a lot of rat blast in a room the chemo kill they one by one sometimes 3 at a time sometimes 6 at a time the rat blast keep come though from where they come from the rat hole we have in the wall the leukemia stem cell so in my humble opinion we can use chemo when the level of blast is high and once we get a low level we have to work on kill leukemia stem cell for instance resveratrol provoke the leukemic cell apoptosis and repair the good stem cell,neutral,0

I have to post this if you read it carefully this article confirm what I have been say about treat cirrhosis through dietary mean rather than being hang out to die treat liver disease the predisposing cause should be identify and eliminate identify and remove any drug or toxin which may potentially hurt the liver supportive care allow time for hepatic regeneration and recovery in some patient rest and confinement will help divert body resource to the healing process at the liver and reduce discomfort cause by inflammation of the liver such as painful belly nausea malaise in other patient supportive care minimize the clinical manifestation of liver disease for variable period of time dietary management is extremely important the goal is to provide all the necessary nutrient which may be lose due to failure of liver processing without overtax the liver with regard to processing of dietary intake high level of top quality protein to provide the essential amino acid in an easily digestible carrier which will not produce high level of ammonia during digestion cottage cheese is good meat tend to produce high level of ammonia high level carbohydrate to drive the metabolism of the body essential fatty acid not less than 6 of the daily intake and a good mineral and vitamin supplement the primary goal for dietary management of liver disorder include maintain metabolic balance while provide nutrient for healing and regeneration of damage tissue other important objective include correct and prevent malnutrition reduce the need for liver work and avoid production of liver toxic and nerve toxic compound control water retention reduce sodium intake diuretic will help in resistant case control concurrent infection with antibiotic deal with the concurrent medical problem as they crop up the patient may develop bleeding problem malabsorption problem and neurological problem each separate problem have to be deal with both individually and as a part of the whole disease entity neurological symptom such as coma need to be address aggressively with a combination of therapy this is an excerpt on how vet treat canine cirrhosis the emphasis being on the word treat nowhere do it say that cirrhosis is untreatable so there is your answer get cirrhosis go see a vet they train for long than doctor do anyway craig,neutral,0

look for other with this type of lung cancer before christ as a type of adenocarcinoma a form of lung cancer that is more common in non smoker they find it by chance when they were scan my chest to prepare for radiation treatment of my breast cancer back in 2009 they surgically remove the upper lobe of my right lung just wonder if I should be do more such as more frequent scan to make sure it have not come back or start in another lung location,neutral,0

my dd and I go to the neuro for the test result I know what he would say and think it was a very expensive co pay to hear she is normal both her eeg and mri w out contrast were normal he say to keep she on the neurontin come back when we need a refill for 6 mo and if she get bad follow up with he if it get well we will wean she off the neurontin now since she have been do really well since sit I am just pray that this will be the last flare up she have this one last 10 day instead of 2 7 but so far she is okay he say that if we are concerned about she being positive for rmsf then we can always take she to columbia infectious disease I think that it would be good to get that back mri in case she do have a pinch nerve or herniate disc my friend say it was constant pain before her surgery and then when we talk after her surgery she say that in the first couple month it was on and off so now I wonder if maybe we are look at that being a possibility if she do have a pinch nerve herniate disc it is just not that bad therefore may never be constant pain for month on end it would not explain dizziness and tingle finger and so on I do not think though if she have spondylitis or early onset of miss it would show up on that mri our ped will do that and it will cost we less to go through he so I plan to wait and see if she start hurt bad again and take she in to he and insist on the back mri with contrast this time I do not think that the mri they do with out contrast would tell we if she have miss only if she have a brain tumor which we figure was not the case dhs cousin die at 3yo of a brain type cancer so I know it is in our history but her bloodwork have always been good so we just wait and see and I know that she is not make this up because sunday when I have to go back on bedr and need all that housework do she never complain or say her ankle back leg was hurt she never limp and so on she was more than helpful and if she was make this up as the rheumy try to say she would have try to get out of all that I am sure dh was help so she do not do a huge amount but more than usual so she get to see her counselor today I know that she is disappoint that we do not get any answer there is not anything wrong with she neurologically which is good but it do not tell we why she is in so much pain so often kwim I do not know if we will ever know I tell she jokingly that with all this pain she have have it should build her tolerance that if and when she have child labor would not be a problem she half smile at I I am glad she still have her sense of humor at least I am lose mine kymberli,negative,-1

virus relate virus xmrv in the blood of patient with chronic fatigue syndrome cfs establish that a retrovirus may play a role in the pathology in this disease knowledge of the immune response might lead to a well understanding of the role xmrv play in this syndrome our objective was to investigate the cytokine and chemokine response in xmrv associate cfs material and method use luminex multi analyte profiling technology we measure cytokine and chemokine value in the plasma of xmrv infect cfs patient and compare these datum to those of healthy control analysis was perform use the gene expression pattern analysis suite and the random forest tree classification algorithm result this study identify a signature of 10 cytokine and chemokine which correctly identify xmrv cfs patient with 93 specificity and 96 sensitivity conclusion these datum show for the first time an immunological pattern associate with xmrv cfs introduction chronic fatigue syndrome cfs is a poorly understand disease of unknown etiology which is commonly characterize by innate immune defect chronic immune activation and dysregulation often lead to neurological malady review in 1 it can also involve other biological system such as the musculoskeletal gastrointestinal and endocrinological system 2 4 although several common symptom are primarily report and predominate they may differ among individual are often intermittent and can persist for year frequently result in substantial disability 5 some of the most commonly report physical symptom include muscle weakness and pain tender or swollen lymph node and chronic flu like symptom 6 memory and concentration impairment blur vision dizziness and sleep abnormality represent some of the cognitive symptom typically observe while immunological symptom often manifest themselves through viral reactivation rnase l dysregulation decrease natural killer nk cell function and susceptibility to opportunistic infection 7 12 nk cell dysregulation may be associate with viral reactivation or viral persistence and may also lead to malignancy 13 14 indeed clinical observation corroborate pathological manifestation in cfs as viral reactivation particularly herpe virus such as cytomegalovirus cmv epstein barr virus ebv and human herpe virus 6 hhv 6 are common occurrence 15 17 moreover epidemiological study have report increase incidence of lymphoma associate with cfs outbreak 18 these clinical observation suggest that a compromise innate immune system may play a role in cfs pathology the completion of the human genome project enable positional cloning study to identify the rnasel gene as the hereditary prostate cancer allele 1 hpc1 19 this discovery prompt robert silverman and his colleague to search for a viral component to hereditary prostate cancer use a viral micro array and tissue biopsy from individual with hereditary prostate cancer they identify and sequence the complete genome of a novel human gammaretrovirus very similar in sequence to xenotropic murine leukemia virus and therefore term the new virus xenotropic murine leukemia virus relate virus xmrv 20 subsequent study perform in our laboratory identify and isolate infectious xmrv in the blood of 67 of cfs patient 21 this work was perform use multiple technique include pcr electron microscopy show bud viral particle western blot analysis of viral protein and serology confirm that infected patient express antibody to xmrv envelope protein in addition gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis confirm these patient were indeed infect with xmrv that was 99 identical to previously publish sequence but was obviously distinct from the only exist xmrv molecular clone vp62 20 take together this work clearly rule out any possibility of gross contamination and additionally represent the first identification and isolation of naturally occur infectious xmrv the connection between cfs and xmrv was far support by the study of lo et al who identify murine leukemia virus mlv relate sequence in the blood of 86 of cfs patient far establish a retroviral association with cfs 22 presently three family of retrovirus are know to infect human the human immunodeficiency viruse hiv the human t cell leukemia viruse htlv and now the human murine leukemia relate virus both hiv and htlv are know to dysregulate the innate immune system and promote the production of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 23 24 in light of the association between xmrv and cfs it is not surprising that some of the most salient observation in cfs are the difference in cytokine and chemokine when compare to healthy control 8 previous report however address the role of these molecule in cfs have produce conflicting result much of this emerge from such hindrance as small sample size a limited number of cytokine survey at one time insufficient patient population stratification and insufficient negative control subject this have result in inconsistent report in the literature for a number of cytokine include interleukin il 6 10 and 12 in spite of these conflict result a number of cytokine and chemokine have consistently been show to be associate with different subgroup of cfs for instance natelson et al show elevated level of il 8 and il 10 in the cerebral spinal fluid of patient with sudden influenza like onset cfs when compare to healthy control 25 additionally chao et al have show neopterin and il 6 to be up regulate in subset of cfs patient indicative of a pro inflammatory immune condition 26 however these study do not analyze the complex relationship between multiple cytokine and clinical disease by apply conventional statistical analysis and machine logic algorithm to the multiplex datum it is possible to identify cytokine and chemokine that are differentially express between two group to support this premise we have use the xmap multi analyte profiling technology that allow simultaneous measurement of multiple biomarker in serum or plasma in this study a panel of 26 cytokine chemokine and growth and angiogenic factor were analyze in blood plasma of cfs patient and healthy control subject this study reveal a signature of 10 cytokine and chemokine which show a specificity of 93 and sensitivity of 96 in diagnose xmrv associate cfs in this patient cohort full text here http www megaupload com d v980uchy if

hello all I am merely 19 year old but I certainly have not ever act my age which is good in that I am mature but bad in that I can not communicate with other my age very well hopefully this mean I will be able to communicate with the most of you since you are likely all old than I my father die from lung cancer due to his cigarette habit when I was only 16 my cat have since develop lung cancer due to second hand smoking and I am show symptom of cancer myself along with great amount of pain but I am no long insure and can not afford test I was once an abuser of percocet and vicoden I was put on the medication for unknown pain throughout my body I go from 5 mg to begin with to 60 mg a day I overdose on ultram once and that is when I begin to take control of my habit ultram is a non narcotic pain killer that work like percocet and vicoden but it much more dangerous and likely to harm you after take control I decide to try and help my fellow victim of addiction even while addicted I would give people advice not to use drug I take percocet vicoden ultram myristicin nutmeg which feel like 200 mg of percocet but later give I intense pain and confusion dextromethorphine which cause some pretty bad health problem luckily short term I was not your typical rebel youngster do drug and have anonymous sex or anything no I was an intellectual who have suffer depression for year and when I find something that could lighten the mental anguish I abuse it now I am in control and I give my mom my pill to distribute to I so that I can not abuse they even if I try have any of you become addicted to drug after being give pain killer for cancer if you are terminal and addicted you may feel like there is no reason to worry about it anyway I can tell you you need to face the end while you retain your personality pain killer are fine when use normally but use too much can deaden who you are and your family will not have memory of the real you when you pass on my father was take 200 mg of percocet a day and eventually morphine he was like a zombie half of the time he once ask my mom to kill he to end his pain he would never have say that with a straight head not nearly overdose on opiate I may have cancer and the bad part is not being able to find out but if I do I want to die with my mind as intact as it can be I would love it if you all those of you who are terminal would also remain intact the bad part was see the drug abuse turn my dad into a zombie he would wander the hall drool and bleed from fall give your family the real you to remember remember I am not against drug just drug abuse drug are fine when use in moderation and for good reason,negative,-1
